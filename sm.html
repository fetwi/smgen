					</header>
					<p>The Manual generally follows the sequence of a typical procurement process. The structure is as
						follows:</p>
					<ol class="double-space" type="a">
						<li>Chapter 1, Public Procurement, provides an overview of the context and the legal framework
							relating to public procurement for the acquisition of goods or services, including
							construction.</li>
						<li>Chapter 2, Defining the Requirement and Requisition Receipt, is about defining the
							requirement for the bid solicitation. While this is often the responsibility of the client
							department, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>
							involvement is still important.</li>
						<li>Chapter 3, Procurement Strategy, describes what the procurement strategy is. This determines
							how the request will be satisfied.</li>
						<li>Chapter 4, Solicitation Process, outlines the actual bid solicitation preparation and
							process. Most of the various methods of solicitation and items that need to be included in
							the bid solicitation are found in this chapter.</li>
						<li>Chapter 5, Evaluation and Selecting the Contractor, explains how to evaluate and select the
							contractor based on the solicitations.</li>
						<li>Chapter 6, Approvals and Authorities, provides the details of the approvals that need to be
							obtained before awarding a contract.</li>
						<li>Chapter 7, Award of Contracts and Issuance of Standing Offers and Supply Arrangements,
							relates to the award of contracts, issuance of standing offers and supply arrangements,
							debriefings, notification to unsuccessful bidders, and other matters surrounding contract
							award and the issuance of standing offers and supply arrangements.</li>
						<li>Chapter 8, Contract Management, offers information regarding contract management during the
							contract. Non-exhaustive examples of this information are contract performance, progress
							payments, subcontracting, warranty work, disputes, terminations and the Vendor Performance
							Corrective Measure Policy.</li>
						<li>Chapter 9, Special Procurements, details procurements where <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> has implemented special
							procedures applicable to identified commodities, clients or projects.</li>
						<li>Chapter 10, Cost and Profit, is generally used when a contract is to be awarded on a
							non-competitive basis for non-commercial goods or services, or in the case of a competitive
							process for such goods or services, only one compliant bid is received, so price
							negotiations with this bidder may be required.</li>
						<li>The Glossary includes words, concepts, titles, etc., used throughout the Manual.</li>

					<ol class="double-space" type="a">
						<li>Ensure integrity<br>Contracting officers must ensure the integrity of the procurement
							process. If there is any doubt that what is being done (or asked by the client to be done)
							might bring the integrity of the process into question, the contracting officer should
							consider suspending the procurement process until the issue is resolved. Issues that cannot
							be resolved satisfactorily at the contracting officer level must be referred to a higher
							authority within <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.
						</li>
						<li>Get involved early<br>The procurement process can be facilitated by advance work being done
							with clients. This includes helping with needs identification and requirement definition,
							procurement strategy development, and drafting of solicitation documents before a
							requisition is actually received. Facilitating the process also includes ensuring that
							accessibility has been considered by clients and, where appropriate or necessary, is
							incorporated into the procurement process, including in the requirement definition and
							solicitation documents. This can be accomplished through ongoing liaison with the client or
							a review of procurement patterns. These methods can be initiated by a client request for
							assistance, or by a more formal process of regular consultation.</li>
						<li>Consult with peers<br>Contracting officers should consult with colleagues, particularly when
							working with an unfamiliar situation, such as a new commodity, or incorporating
							accessibility into procurement requirements or solicitation documents. Their experience and
							advice may help to arrive at a sound decision. Referring to previous files can also be
							instructive, particularly for estimating things like business volume under a new contract
							where there is a current contract covering substantially the same activities.</li>
						<li>Liaise with the client<br>The contracting officer should keep clients informed and involved,
							and in order to develop responsive, creative and flexible procurement strategies, their
							departmental needs must be understood, as well as their specific technical and accessibility
							requirements. When consulting the client, make the purpose plain, so that if there is a
							problem with a proposed approach a solution that achieves the purpose can be developed. The
							contracting officer must work with the client towards their operational objectives.</li>
						<li>Use specialists<br>The contracting officer should seek advice from the following
							specialists: Legal Services, policy advisors, Access to Information and Privacy officers,
							quality control officers, cost analysts and risk management advisors. Specialists are
							available to provide guidance and recommendations in their areas of expertise. The mandatory
							or discretionary use of cost and price analysis specialists is detailed in the <a

						<li>Communicate effectively<br>Contracting officers should be very clear in communications.
							Written instructions accompanying each bid solicitation, for example, should be clear with
							no ambiguity, and be easily understood by all parties.</li>
						<li>Maintain confidentiality<br>The contracting officer must treat all information of a
							confidential or personal nature, including bid information, in a secure and confidential
							manner. This ensures the integrity of the contracting process, and protects the interests of
							suppliers and clients.</li>
						<li>Obtain confirmation<br>The contracting officer should obtain written confirmation of
							significant information, agreements and discussions, such as confirmation of an unusually
							low price, or extension of a bid validity period by the bidder.</li>
						<li>Select the appropriate contracting method<ol class="double-space" type="i">
								<li>Depending on which commodity is being procured, the appropriate contracting method
									may be a standing offer, a supply arrangement, a government-wide or
									multi-departmental contract, or a normal contract. See <a href="#section-3.15">3.15
										Non-competitive Contracting Process</a> for details on the usage of the
									different methods.</li>
								<li>Some commodities are available via mandatory standing offers, and these must be used
									unless there is a valid reason to deviate.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Commodity knowledge<br>Contracting officers should develop their understanding of their
							commodity&#39;s industry, the market conditions, opportunities, accessibility standards and
							options, and other pertinent factors of each commodity, which then affects the choices made
							by contracting officers in determining, for example, such things as the basis of payment and
							the selection methodology. Clients should also use their understanding of the commodity,
							including relevant standards or best practices, when defining their technical and
							accessibility requirements and scope. This would include any market analysis of capacity
							when the procurement is subject to a Comprehensive Land Claims Agreement.<br>Contracting
							officers should also keep themselves informed about such things as the proposed
							contractor&#39;s performance history, financial situation and practices, before recommending
							a contract award. It also means keeping up to date with a contractor during the performance
							of a contract.</li>
						<li>Life Cycle Management of Assets<br>Life Cycle Management of Assets (LCMA) is an integrated
							approach to materiel management that looks at the process as a complete system rather than
							separate activities. While this process is primarily the responsibility of materiel managers
							within client departments, procurement and disposal are a part of this process so
							contracting officers should discuss with the client the implications of the life cycle
							management process for each procurement.</li>
						<li>Maintain records<br>Contracting officers must keep procurement files up to date for reasons
							of good management, access to information requests as well as for audit purposes. Current
							files should be kept up to date for anyone who may have to consult the file or assume
							responsibility for it at a later date. For further details, please refer to section <a
								href="#section-1.80">1.80 Information management and file documentation in the
								procurement process</a>, <a href="#annex-1.4">Annex 1.4: Guidelines on paper file
								documentation for procurement</a> and <a href="#annex-1.5">Annex 1.5: Guidelines on
								electronic file documentation for procurement</a>.</li>
						<li>Use standard documents<br>For every solicitation process (with the exception of construction
							and architecture and engineering services), whether for competitive or non-competitive
							requirements, contracting officers must only use the departmental <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/Standard-Acquisition-Clauses-and-Conditions-SACC-Manual/Standard-Procurement-Templates">standard
								procurement templates</a> and the clauses of the Standard Acquisition Clauses and
							Conditions (SACC) Manual. Contracting officers should obtain from their supervisor the most
							current standard documents that have been developed in accordance with these templates
							within their respective areas. Directorates requiring assistance in developing documents
							based on these templates should contact the Strategic Policy Development and Integration
							Directorate of the Strategic Policy Sector by email at: <a

							former department of Public Works and the former Department of Supply and Services together
							with the Translation Bureau and the Telecommunication Services for government. The legal
							name of the Department is &quot;Department of Public Works and Government Services&quot;;
							while &quot;Public Works and Government Services Canada&quot; or &quot; <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>&quot; is the common
							usage name. The legal name of the Department must be used for the preparation and execution
							of legal documents.</li>
						<li>The Act:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
								<li>constitutes the Department;</li>
								<li>provides for the appointment of a minister who has the management and direction of
									the Department;</li>
								<li>provides for the appointment of a deputy minister as deputy head of the Department;

						</li>
						<li>Sections 6 and 7 outline in detail the powers, duties and functions of the Minister. With

								<li>acquisition and provision of articles, supplies, machinery, equipment and other

								<li>construction, maintenance and repair of public works, federal real property and
									federal immovable.</li>

							authorize other Ministers, to whom he or she has delegated powers under the Act, to sub
							delegate those powers to the &quot;chief executive&quot; of the relevant department.
							Subsection 8(3) empowers a minister receiving the authority to sub-delegate to the officials

							empowers those officials in turn, to sub-delegate to departmental officials under their

								<li>Non-discrimination and national treatment, which prohibit discrimination against
									goods, services, and suppliers of other Parties to the trade agreements, or from
									discriminating against domestic suppliers based on the degree of foreign affiliation
									or ownership. For the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), this means Parties
									cannot discriminate between the goods, services, or suppliers of particular
									Provinces, Territories, or regions; and</li>
								<li>Prohibition of offsets. Offsets are any condition or undertaking that encourages
									local development, such as the use of domestic or local content. Note that, when a
									procurement is covered by the <abbr
										title="Canadian Free Trade Agreement">CFTA</abbr> only, Canadian content
									requirements may be applied, so long as those requirements do not discriminate
									between Provinces, Territories, or regions and are applied in a manner consistent
									with <abbr title="Canadian Free Trade Agreement">CFTA</abbr> obligations. For
									example, see <a href="#section-3.130">Section 3.130 Canadian Content</a>.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The steps to determine coverage under a trade agreement are the same for all of Canada’s
							trade agreements. A procurement is covered by trade agreement if:<ol type="i">
								<li>its estimated value is equal to or greater than the relevant threshold;</li>
								<li>the client department is covered;</li>
								<li>the requirement is covered; and</li>
								<li>there is no express exclusion applicable (e.g. shipbuilding, etc.).*</li>
							</ol>
							<p>All four criteria must be met in order for the procurement to be covered by the
								applicable trade agreement. These steps are described in more detail in <a
									href="#section-1.25.3">Section 1.25.3 Determining coverage under a trade
									agreement</a>.</p>
							<p>* If a set-aside or an exception is made use of or relied upon (e.g. National Security
								Exception (NSE), general exception for human life and safety, set-aside for minority
								businesses, etc.), some or all aspects of the procurement may not be subject to certain
								trade agreement obligations.</p>
							<p>In such cases, in order to reduce risk, contracting officers should continue to follow
								the obligations of the trade agreements to the greatest extent possible, deviating only
								where necessary to serve the purpose(s) for which the exception is being used or the
								set-aside is being applied.</p>
						</li>
						<li>Coverage Under Multiple Agreements:<br>A proposed procurement can be, and often is, covered
							by more than one trade agreement. In these instances, all trade agreements must be complied
							with at the same time. In order to accomplish this, the procedures to be followed are the
							trade agreement procedures that are considered the most rigorous. This can generally be
							achieved by compliance with the procedural obligations of the <abbr
								title="World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</abbr>.

					<li>The objective of the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16578"
							rel="external">Policy on Government Security</a>, as it pertains to contracting, is to
						ensure that sensitive information and assets of the government are properly protected when
						entrusted to industry. The role of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) in this
						process is to ensure that individuals and organizations that will have access to or will possess
						protected or classified information, assets or sites have first received the necessary security
						screening or clearance through the <a
							href="https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/esc-src/index-eng.html" rel="external">Contract Security
							Program (CSP)</a>, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.
					</li>
					<li><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>&#39;s Industrial Security
						Sector (ISS) is the Government of Canada’s authority for contract security and the lead in the
						public service to administer the <abbr title="Contract Security Program">CSP</abbr>. The <abbr
							title="Contract Security Program">CSP</abbr> is intended to ensure protection of Canadian
						and foreign government sensitive assets and information entrusted to industry for contracts
						administered by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and, on
						request, for contracts administered by other government departments, foreign governments, or
						international organizations. <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s <abbr
							title="Contract Security Program">CSP</abbr> is responsible for validating and/or security
						screening private sector organizations and personnel requiring access to sensitive government
						information and assets. The Program also identifies the appropriate security terms and
						conditions to be included in each contractual instrument and ensures that contractors comply
						with the security requirements provided by the client department for safeguarding, disclosing,
						destroying, removing, modifying and interruption of government sensitive information/assets.
					</li>
					<li>The project authority and the Chief Security Officers of departments and agencies are
						responsible for ensuring that their department or agency adheres to the Policy on Government
						Security and that provisions are made for any suppliers used to provide goods or services to
						ensure that they also meet the applicable security requirements.</li>
					<li>The <abbr title="Contract Security Program">CSP</abbr> is responsible, among other things, for
						the following services:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>provide the appropriate security clauses to be inserted into solicitation and
								contractual documents, as required, when a <a
									href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/tbsf-fsct/350-103-eng.asp" rel="external">Security
									Requirements Check List (SRCL)</a> has been used to identify the needs and processed
								by the <abbr title="Contract Security Program">CSP</abbr>;</li>
							<li>carry out the appropriate security screening for suppliers that are awarded contracts
								with security requirements and ensure that they maintain their security clearance during
								the period of the contract;</li>
							<li>ensure that inspections are undertaken and regularly renewed at the suppliers&#39;
								facilities, if required and appropriate; and</li>
							<li>carry out the security screening of the supplier personnel as required by the provisions
								of the contract.</li>
						</ol>Note that contracts may still have a security requirement, even though the contractual
						documents themselves are not designated as PROTECTED/CLASSIFIED.</li>
					<li>Upon request, the <abbr title="Contract Security Program">CSP</abbr> also handles the security
						requirements of contracts awarded by other government departments under their own contracting
						authority.</li>
					<li>The Policy is issued by Treasury Board under the authority derived from government decision and
						section 7 of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/"
								rel="external">Financial Administration Act</a></cite>.</li>
					<li>Each federal department is responsible for protecting sensitive information and assets under its
						control not only in its own operations but also throughout the bidding, negotiating, awarding,
						carrying out, and terminating of any contracts it manages. In contracting, the <abbr
							title="Security Requirements Check List">SRCL</abbr> is used by <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and client departments and
						agencies to identify their security requirements in a contract. See <a href="#section-2.50">2.50
							Contract Security Requirements</a>, <a href="#section-3.55">3.55 Contract Security
							Requirements (personnel or organization)</a> and <a href="#section-7.55">7.55 Contract
							security requirements</a> for more information on contract
						security.<br><strong>Note</strong>: The Contract Security Program (CSP) will provide the results
						of its screening to the contracting officers/client departments, who will then make a decision
						concerning contract award. The <abbr title="Contract Security Program">CSP</abbr> will not
						approve or disapprove the decision. It is not its role.</li>

						set out in the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12450"
							rel="external"><cite>ARCHIVED - Privacy Impact Assessment Policy</cite></a>.</li>
					<li>The Policy on Privacy Protection applies to government institutions as defined in section 3 of
						the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html"
								rel="external">Privacy Act</a></cite> (the Act), including parent Crown corporations and
						any wholly owned subsidiary of these corporations. It does not apply to the Bank of Canada and
						to the information excluded under the Act.</li>
					<li>The Government of Canada is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals with respect to
						the personal information that is under the control of government institutions. The government
						recognizes that this protection is an essential element in maintaining public trust in
						government. The Supreme Court of Canada has characterized the Act as
						&quot;quasi-constitutional&quot; because of the role privacy plays in the preservation of a free
						and democratic society.</li>
					<li>Privacy protection in this sense means limiting government interventions into the private lives
						of Canadians to lawful and necessary purposes. It also means that government must ensure a high
						standard of care for personal information under the control of government institutions. The
						government also has to respond to requests for access to personal information. Sound information
						management plays a key role in facilitating the exercise of access rights under the Act and
						ensuring privacy protection.</li>
					<li>Through government contracts, contracting authorities, clients and other departmental
						organizations are privy to individual and company private information. It is imperative that
						precautions are taken in contracting to safeguard this information. Some examples include such
						things as individual resumes that contain very personal information and secondly company private
						information that in the wrong hands may provide competing companies technical advantages, trade
						secrets or financial information.</li>
					<li><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> must ensure safeguards
						are put in place to protect individual and company private information by ensuring information
						is stored securely and that information is handled through limited distribution and provided
						only as necessary. Under no circumstances should a company&#39;s private information or an
						individual&#39;s personal information be shared with competitors or placed in the public domain
						without the written authorization of the originator of the information.</li>
					<li>Contracting officers should review the <a

							<li>Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) and the Department of National

							<li>This agreement identifies the division of responsibilities as agreed by each department

								specifications, acquired on behalf of <abbr
									title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr>.<br>It does not deal with materiel

								specifications: Includes all materiel and services, including repair and overhaul, as
								well as research and development for which a military or other <abbr

							<li><abbr title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr> will be solely responsible for
								the designation of materiel and services as &quot;Military&quot; or
								&quot;Non-Military&quot; in technical and procurement documentation.</li>
							<li>The division of responsibilities identified for a subactivity does not mean exclusive
								involvement by one department. Close participation and coordination by both departments
								is essential throughout the various phases of the procurement program.<br>Where
								participation by the other department is indicated, the responsible department is
								expected to initiate the consultation. However, it does not preclude either department
								from requesting participation in, or consultation on, any given subactivity relative to

					<li>Overview<ol type="a">
							<li>These guidelines are intended to help contracting officers in organizing their
								procurement paper files. Consistent filing methods allow for a more organized approach
								to procurement and ensure that anyone reviewing the file is able to locate documents
								with minimal effort. The importance of proper filing techniques is more evident when,
								for example, information is needed quickly for audits, <a
									href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/" rel="external">Access to
									Information</a> requests, <a href="#section-1.35.1">Canadian International Trade
									Tribunal complaints</a>, litigations, when a contracting officer takes over file
								responsibility or needs to determine the status of the procurement process, <abbr

							<li>As a general rule, documents should be filed in chronological order. A proposed format
								for file organization is set out below. The list of documents is not intended to be
								comprehensive and is subject to the professional opinion of the contracting officers.
								All the documents may not be applicable in all cases. Furthermore, file organization and
								the required documents may vary in accordance with regional/sectoral procedures and
								guidelines. Separate file volumes may be warranted to accommodate the excessive physical
								size of some documents.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Paper information<ol type="a">
							<li>Any information received or created in paper format, must be maintained in its original

								legal purposes.</li>
							<li>All information, hardcopy and electronic associated with a particular requirement must
								be kept in their original format and made available to complete procurement support
								activities and processes; and</li>
							<li>When it is necessary to maintain information in more than one location <abbr

				</header>
				<ol>
					<li>Overview<ol type="a">
							<li>These guidelines are intended to help contracting officers in organizing their
								electronic procurement files. Consistent documenting methods allow for a more organized
								approach to procurement and ensure that anyone reviewing the file is able to locate
								documents with minimal effort. The importance of proper documenting techniques is more
								evident when, for example, information is needed quickly for audits, <a
									href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/" rel="external">Access to
									Information</a> requests, <a href="#section-1.35.1">Canadian International Trade
									Tribunal complaints</a>, litigations or when a contracting officer takes over file
								responsibility and needs to determine the status of the procurement process, <abbr
									lang="la" title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></li>
							<li>The format for electronic file organization is set out below. The list of documents is
								not intended to be comprehensive and is subject to the professional opinion of the
								contracting officers. All the documents may not be applicable in all cases. Furthermore,
								file organization and the required documents may vary in accordance with
								regional/sectoral procedures and guidelines.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Electronic information in the Electronic Procurement Solution (EPS)<p>For all procurement files
							created in the <abbr title="Electronic Procurement Solution">EPS</abbr> and procurement
							files that have been migrated to the <abbr
								title="Electronic Procurement Solution">EPS</abbr>, contracting officers are required
							to:</p>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Maintain any new information created or received in the <abbr
									title="Electronic Procurement Solution">EPS</abbr> in its original format in the
								<abbr title="Electronic Procurement Solution">EPS</abbr>, including any information
								listed in Section 4 of these guidelines such as bidder’s technical and financial bids,
								questions and answers, or correspondence;</li>
							<li>Maintain electronic information created or received outside of the <abbr
									title="Electronic Procurement Solution">EPS</abbr> in its original format and filed
								in GCdocs, in the applicable GCdocs procurement case file folder;</li>
							<li>Avoid duplicating information that was created or received in the <abbr
									title="Electronic Procurement Solution">EPS</abbr> into GCdocs; and</li>
							<li>Add a cross-reference in the <abbr title="Electronic Procurement Solution">EPS</abbr>
								and GCdocs when it is necessary to maintain information in both systems.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Electronic information in GCdocs<ol type="a">

									<li>Solicitation</li>
									<li>Evaluation and award</li>
									<li>Contract management</li>

							<li>When it is necessary to maintain information in more than one location <abbr lang="la"

						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Procurement file naming convention<p>It is important that contracting officers name the
							procurement files appropriately, in a way that describes accurately what it contains.
							Descriptive file names are an essential part of organizing, sharing, and keeping track of
							information. For more details, please consult the <a class="gov-auth-link"

					<li>Defining the requirements of a procurement is the cornerstone of a successful procurement
						process. The contracting officer must understand completely what he/she is about to procure.
						There are many aspects to consider.</li>
					<li>When defining the requirement, client departments must keep in mind not only the goods and
						services needed, but also the legal framework regulating the goods and services being procured
						(see <a href="#section-1.15">1.15 The Legal Framework of Contracting</a>). Client departments
						can save significant time and money if there is a clear and well-prepared description of what is
						required. Early involvement of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) contracting
						officers in the process can help achieve this.</li>
					<li>Identifying the needs and carefully developing the requirements at the earliest stages of
						requirements definition are the greatest contribution in obtaining the right good or service and
						best price, and can minimize the need for changes later.</li>
					<li>Requirements are best defined in a manner that allows competition and ensures best value.
						Contracting officers may be able to suggest wording, which defines requirements in terms of
						operational requirements rather than using brand names or proprietary technical specifications.
					</li>
					<li><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> can help client
						departments identify special requirements related to accessibility, green procurement, security,
						progress reports, special packaging, transportation, bonding, etc. that suppliers may need to
						address in their bids.</li>
					<li>The contracting officer and the client department must work together to ensure that all concerns
						are addressed from the beginning of the process to receipt of the final deliverable.</li>
					<li>Writing clear and concise contractual documents, using the right words and plain language, is
						the best method to adopt, to obtain satisfaction and avoid disputes.</li>
					<li>For more information on the requirements definition, consult the Statement of Work Guide

							<li>It is the clients’ responsibility to comply with the legal duty to consult and, where

						supports sustainable development objectives. This policy is all encompassing and it applies
						across all four stages of the procurement process, from planning and acquisition through use and

					<li>The contracting officer, in assisting a client with the needs definition process, should analyze
						with the client what opportunities may exist to support their obligations, as well as their
						departmental targets related to green procurement. A key consideration is whether it is actually
						necessary to make the new purchase. Ultimately, avoiding a purchase will be the most
						environmentally preferable and economical option.</li>
					<li>Some key considerations in defining the requirement are to:<ol type="i">
							<li>evaluate the need, utilization and scale of the procurement, and reduce the need if
								possible;</li>
							<li>determine that the quantity requested is appropriate and definitely will be used (the
								feasibility of short term leasing, renting or sharing of the good should be
								investigated);</li>
							<li>inquire as to whether or not the requirement could be satisfied internally, through a
								different division or section of the organization or through government surplus
								supplies;</li>
							<li>combine the requirement, if appropriate, with one or several other departments to take

						accessible to all Canadians through the identification and removal of accessibility barriers and
						the prevention of new ones. This Directive applies to all Government procurement decisions, in
						both the planning and execution phases, for which accessibility criteria must be considered when
						defining the requirements of the procurement. The Directive states that departments must:<ol
							type="i">
							<li>Where appropriate, include accessibility considerations when specifying requirements for
								goods, services and construction, and ensuring that deliverables incorporate
								accessibility features;</li>
							<li>Ensure clear justification is documented if it is determined that accessibility

								not appropriate to include them as part of commodity specifications, or if it is not
								possible to obtain goods, services or construction that comply.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Contracting officers, as commodity experts, should guide the client in circumstances where there
						is an awareness of accessibility criteria being used for solicitations with the same type of
						commodity. Contracting officers are responsible for:<ol type="i">
							<li>ensuring that clients have considered accessibility and included accessibility
								requirements, if applicable;</li>
							<li>playing a challenge-function role with the Technical Authority if accessibility
								standards apply to the procurement and accessibility has not been addressed;</li>
							<li>ensuring that the Technical Authority provides a written justification if accessibility
								criteria are not appropriate or the procurement of goods or services that comply were
								unable to be obtained.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The Technical Authority is responsible for:<ol type="i">
							<li>ensuring accessibility is considered when defining the requirements of the procurement
								and including accessibility criteria in the specifications, if applicable;</li>
							<li>providing a justification when accessibility criteria are not included.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Key considerations in defining the requirement are:<ol type="i">
							<li>considering leveraging a Request For Information (RFI) if the Technical Authority is
								unsure of market capacity of accessible goods or services;</li>
							<li>consulting with end-users or groups representing persons with disabilities, considering
								accessibility standards or portions of them, or leveraging universal design principles
								to develop accessibility criteria to be built into the requirements of the procurement
								to build flexibility into the design so that end-deliverables incorporate accessibility
								features;</li>
							<li>in absence of accessibility standards, it should be determined if suppliers offer goods
								or services that have flexibility or features built into the design to enable the
								broadest range of end-user;</li>
							<li>accessibility requirements, unless not appropriate or applicable, can be identified in
								the statement of work (SOW) when defining the requirements and in the bid evaluation
								criteria;</li>
							<li>prototypes and product demonstrations can be leveraged to allow end-users to test out

				</header>
				<p>Client departments are invited to engage with <abbr
						title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting officers early in
					the process. This engagement may focus on different topics and may include various levels of
					engagement. It may be long before a signed requisition is received within <abbr
						title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.</p>
				<p>The early engagement with industry may also take many forms, such as issuing Letters of Interest
					(LOIs), Requests for Information (RFIs), one-on-one consultations with suppliers, the holding of
					industry days, etc. By engaging clients and suppliers through early and ongoing consultation and
					dialogue, contracting officers are better situated to identify the various complexities and risks
					associated with a client’s requirement, enabling the development of mitigation strategies. Acquiring
					the knowledge of the requirement and its related complexities and risk better positions all
					stakeholders for a successful procurement that meets the client’s needs.</p>
				<p>Various tools are available to facilitate this early engagement. Some are listed below:</p>
				<ul>

						topics such as engagement and communications, governance, socio-economic objectives, risk
						management, etc. located on GCpedia on the <a class="gov-auth-link"

					<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2010-01-11</time>)</p>
				</header>
				<p>Public Works and Government Services (PWGSC) is sometimes asked to process requirements when the
					procurement process was initiated by client departments (e.g. sourcing, bidding, evaluation,
					selection). The client department remains responsible for all of their actions, which may or may not
					be in compliance with <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> or <abbr
						title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> policies or applicable
					legislation. <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> will attempt to
					mitigate risks associated with such a requirement; however, the client department will remain
					responsible even if <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> agrees to
					continue or restart the procurement process. To reduce the risk of complaints and challenges
					associated with these procurements, the following procedures must be followed:</p>
				<ol class="double-space" type="a">
					<li>Upon receipt of a requisition for a contract or contract amendment, where the client has already
						taken certain steps in the procurement process, the contracting officer must alert the manager
						to the situation.</li>
					<li>The contracting officer will review the procurement process already initiated by the client, to
						identify any deviations from standard practice or policy. The contracting officer must develop a
						clear understanding of all procurement-related activities that have been completed, including
						whether a contract has been awarded or the supplier has been given the go-ahead to commence
						work. Where a contract has been awarded, or the supplier authorized to proceed with the work, <a
							href="#section-2.75">2.75 Confirming Orders and Contracts Involving Pre-contractual Work</a>
						will apply.</li>
					<li>In the event that some of the actions of the procurement process initiated by client departments
						do not adhere to the established supply policy guidelines, <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> may have to restart the
						procurement process. Whenever a contracting officer must act in a way not clearly set out in
						this Manual, integrity and its supporting principles provide necessary guidance (see <a

					<li><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> does not normally place

					<li>Requests for confirming orders must be evaluated and processed on the basis of the circumstances

						procurement procedures, return of the request to the client department should be a prime

					<li>When the work has been completed, Legal Services will prepare a confirming order that will

					<h2><a id="annex-2.2">Annex 2.2: Green Procurement: Environmental Factors and Evaluation
							Indicators</a></h2>
					<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2023-04-11</time>)</p>
				</header>
				<p>Client departments, with the assistance of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), are
					responsible for all four stages of the procurement process, from planning and acquisition through
					use and disposal. The following lists are an example of aspects to be considered:</p>
				<ol class="double-space">
					<li>Environmental Factors and Related Cost Elements<br>Examples of environmental factors that should
						be taken into consideration in assessing value for money are provided below. These are expressed
						in terms of cost elements that client departments may take into consideration in the evaluation
						of bids. These include but are not limited to:<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>Life Cycle Cost (LCC) Considerations: A <abbr title="Life Cycle Cost">LCC</abbr>
								analysis may be required as part of the procurement process, to account for elements
								other than the upfront capital investment, such as:<ol type="i">
									<li>operation costs, such as energy or water consumed by the good over its life;
									</li>
									<li>indirect costs. For example, less energy efficient information technology
										equipment will produce more heat causing the building&#39;s air conditioning
										system to work harder, and increased electricity costs;</li>
									<li>administrative costs, such as complying to the Workplace Hazardous Materials
										Information System (WHMIS);</li>
									<li>investing up front to save costs later, such as specifying higher levels of
										insulation where the extra expenditure can be recovered from lower energy costs;
									</li>
									<li>costs of disposal arrangements.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Other Environmental Considerations:<ol type="i">
									<li>use of refurbished parts or products, where possible;</li>
									<li>recyclability: this is thought to be the key since purchasers can create markets
										for their own waste, such as paper, toner cartridges, etc., through the
										transformation and sale of products containing recycled materials;</li>
									<li>establishing minimum environmental performance standards for commodities where
										there is a sufficient supplier base to support competition;</li>
									<li>where the supplier base is limited, include incentives for meeting extra
										environmental performance criteria; and</li>
									<li>use of contractual terms, to define environmental obligations, such as packaging
										take-back, use of certified recyclers for e-waste.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Environmental Evaluation Indicators<br>Examples of indicators that should be examined to develop
						evaluation criteria are as follows:<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>Environmental Certification<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Has the good/service been certified through an independent program, such as the
										Environmental Choice Program or Energy Star?</li>
									<li>Have studies of the environmental attributes of the good/service been completed?
									</li>
									<li>Does the good/service have a certified Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)
										such as Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Group, Underwriters Laboratories of
										Canada (UL Solutions) or another accredited certification body?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Energy and Resource Efficiency<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Do you purchase used, remanufactured, rebuilt or refurbished goods and/or
										materials?</li>
									<li>Does this good make efficient use of resources and energy throughout its life
										cycle?</li>
									<li>Does this good reduce waste?</li>
									<li>Suppliers should be instructed to indicate if the good has any energy, water or
										fuel saving features, such as Power Down Mode.</li>
									<li>Are there measures to extend the useful life of the good; for example, re-use,
										refill, recharge, recondition?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Recycled Content<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Does the good include post-consumer recycled content?</li>
									<li>What type and what percentage are recycled materials?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Hazardous Replacement<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Does the supplier offer a non-hazardous replacement or alternative for this
										good?</li>
									<li>Does the good require Safety Data Sheets (SDS)?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Performance Testing<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Is it possible to test the good/service, prior to purchase?</li>
									<li>Does the good meet the performance specifications?</li>
									<li>Is there any documented past performance? (For example, annual reports,
										environmental performance reports).</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Packaging<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Is packaging reduced to the bare minimum required to ensure that the good is
										delivered in perfect working condition?</li>
									<li>Can the good be acquired in bulk or concentrated form?</li>
									<li>Will the supplier remove the packaging from the site following installation?
									</li>
									<li>Is the packaging biodegradable, reusable, contain reusable parts or is it
										recyclable?</li>
									<li>Does the packaging material contain post-consumer recycled materials?</li>
									<li>Does the packaging eliminate or minimize use of single-use plastics?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>On Site Waste Management<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>During the project, will all waste be source separated on site and recycled?
									</li>
									<li>Request information and reward environmentally sound stewardship and use of
										certified haulers/sites.</li>
									<li>Is the good or service designed to minimize waste (for example, catering service
										using dishes that are biodegradable or made of porcelain or glass rather than
										Styrofoam)?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Return for Disassembly and Recycling<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Does the good include a manufacturer return for recycling policy?</li>
									<li>Can the good be recycled in the end-users geographic area?</li>
									<li>Will consumables (such as toner cartridges) be accepted for recycling?</li>
									<li>Is the good easily disassembled?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Warranties<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>What is the expected useful life span of the good?</li>
									<li>How long is the warranty, and should you purchase an extended warranty?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Maintenance<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Is the good designed for easy maintenance and repair?</li>
									<li>Are maintenance and replacement parts readily available and reasonably priced?
									</li>
									<li>Is the good easy and cost effective to upgrade?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Environmental Attributes of the Supplier<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Does the supplier have a certification or registration (for example, ISO 14001
										registration)?</li>
									<li>Has the supplier received any regulatory environmental violations within the
										past five years?</li>
									<li>Is the supplier participating in a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission target-setting,
										reduction and disclosure program, such as the <a

				<p>Client departments, with the assistance of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), are
					responsible for all four stages of the procurement process, from planning and acquisition through
					use and disposal. The following lists are an example of aspects to be considered:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Accessibility factors and related cost elements<br>Examples of accessibility factors that should
						be taken into consideration in assessing best value are provided below. These are expressed in
						terms of cost elements that client departments may take into consideration in the evaluation of
						bids. These include but are not limited to:<ol type="a">
							<li>Investing up front to save costs later, such as procuring goods and services that have
								flexibility built in and are easily adaptable to be the most accessible for the widest
								range of end-users;</li>
							<li>Establishing performance standards for commodities where there is a sufficient supplier
								base to support competition;</li>
							<li>Where supplier base is limited, include incentives for meeting extra accessibility
								performance criteria;</li>
							<li>Use of contractual terms, to define accessibility obligations, such as including
								mandatory accessibility criteria or standards.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Accessibility evaluation indicators<br>Examples of indicators that should be examined to develop
						evaluation criteria are as follows:<ol type="a">
							<li>Market capacity<br>Does market capacity exist to support the inclusion of mandatory
								accessibility criteria in the procurement?</li>
							<li>Standing Offers/Supply Arrangements<br>Have procurement instruments been updated to
								incorporate technical specifications related to accessibility?</li>
							<li>Performance testing<ol type="i">
									<li>Would it be useful to have a prototype or product demonstration to validate
										accessibility features?</li>
									<li>Does a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template exist for the product to
										demonstrate accessibility?</li>
									<li>Is it possible to test the good/service, prior to purchase?</li>
									<li>How will suppliers demonstrate the accessibility of their good or service
										compliance?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Adaptability<ol type="i">
									<li>Is flexibility built into the design so the good can easily be modified or
										adapted to meet accessibility needs?</li>
									<li>Are there accessibility add-ons that can be purchased to enhance the
										accessibility of the good or service being procured?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Accessibility standards<ol type="i">
									<li>Do the good(s) or service(s) comply with an industry standard for accessibility?
										Have the standards been implemented?</li>
									<li>Will accessibility features be the default setting for the good(s) or
										service(s)?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Packaging<ol type="i">
									<li>Does packaging take into account accessibility (e.g. easy to open)?</li>
									<li>Are instructions for using the product/technology clear and easy to follow, and
										available in accessible formats?</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Maintenance<ol type="i">
									<li>Is the good designed for easy maintenance and repair of accessibility features?
									</li>
									<li>Is the good easy and cost effective for accessibility add-ons or upgrades?</li>

					<li>A procurement strategy defines in general terms how a good, service, or construction will be
						procured, and will include, at the highest level, the determination to proceed competitively or
						non-competitively and applicable details in support of industrial and regional benefits or other
						national objectives. The strategy could be quite straightforward, such as the decision to use a
						standing offer, or could be more detailed, which would be used for major projects.</li>
					<li>The development of a procurement strategy begins with the first meeting between Public Works and
						Government Services Canada and the client, and often even before this point. It is the most
						important step in the procurement process as it influences the scope of the requirement and
						determines the extent of competition.</li>
					<li>In developing the procurement strategy, the guiding principles described in <a
							href="#section-1.10.5">1.10.5 Guiding Principles</a> must be taken into consideration.
						Specifically, the procurement strategy must satisfy the client&#39;s operational requirements
						and comply with legal requirements, while achieving best value, and advancing national
						objectives.</li>
					<li>The assessment of pricing considerations, options and potential risks and the alignment of
						pricing strategy to the procurement strategy is done early on and throughout the acquisition
						lifecycle. Refer to Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the <a

						<li>As soon as the key elements of the procurement strategy have been determined, or when it is

						<li>The procurement risk assessment process is applied in order to determine the level of risk

						<li>Client departments and agencies continue to be able to acquire goods and services as they
							have in the past. However, they must first verify whether a mandatory standing offer or
							supply arrangement exists that meets their requirements. If one does, clients must use it.
						</li>
						<li>On receipt of a requisition for any goods or services within these identified commodity
							groups, contracting officers must determine if an existing standing offer or supply
							arrangement can meet the requirement. If so, that standing offer or supply arrangement must
							be utilized.</li>
						<li>The goods or services should not duplicate those already provided under an existing standing
							offer or supply arrangement at the national or regional level. If the required goods or
							services are similar, or identical, in nature to goods or services available under existing
							standing offers or supply arrangements, a full rationale must be provided to justify using
							another procurement instrument or method of supply. For the process on creating a new
							standing offer or supply arrangement, see <a href="#section-3.205">3.205 Review Process for
								Creation, Renewal and Extension of Standing Offers and Supply Arrangements</a>.</li>
						<li>It should be pointed out to clients that when they use a mandatory standing offer or supply
							arrangement (with the exception of Departmental Individual Standing Offers), they can
							receive the goods or services faster and with less administrative cost than by sending a
							requisition to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>. The
							value of the acquisition will be limited to their Treasury Board Secretariat delegated
							purchasing authorities.</li>
						<li>Mandatory procurement instruments, such as standing offers and supply arrangements, must be
							used by client departments acting on their own behalf, or by <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> handling a requisition,
							unless one of the following applies:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
								<li>the good or service available through the mandatory standing offer or supply
									arrangement does not meet justifiable operational requirements, including
									specifications or delivery dates.</li>
								<li>the value of the requirement exceeds the call-up limitation of the standing offer or
									the scope of the supply arrangement.</li>
								<li>an existing contract is in place, which guarantees the work to another supplier.
								</li>
								<li>the requirement is subject to contracting obligations under Comprehensive Land
									Claims Agreement(s) (CLCA), and no mandatory standing offer/supply arrangement
									exists which addresses the contracting obligations of the applicable <abbr
										title="Comprehensive Land Claims Agreement">CLCA</abbr>(s);</li>
								<li>the requirement will be set aside under the Procurement Strategy for Indigenous
									Business (PSIB), and no mandatory procurement instrument exists for <abbr
										title="Procurement Strategy for Indigenous Business">PSIB</abbr> set-asides;
								</li>
								<li>the goods or services will be acquired from CORCAN as a stores transfer order.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>If <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> is handling a
							requisition, and the contracting officer informs the client that a mandatory standing offer
							or supply arrangement exists for the client&#39;s requirement, and the client disputes the
							opinion, the contracting officer will seek a decision from the appropriate manager or
							director responsible for that standing offer or supply arrangement. If the client believes
							that the decision rendered is not appropriate, the client may refer the issue to their
							respective Acquisitions Account Manager in the Client Engagement Directorate in Procurement
							Assistance Canada (PAC). Although, the Account Managers do not make the final decision, they
							will carefully assess the issue with the director responsible for that standing offer or
							supply arrangement, in order to have a clear and timely resolution.</li>
						<li>If a client department is handling its own procurement, and does not want to use a mandatory
							standing offer or supply arrangement, it must contact the contracting officer responsible
							for the appropriate standing offer or supply arrangement (the one that the client department
							does not want to use), and explain the reason(s).</li>
						<li>If the reason(s) are disputed by the contracting offer, the contracting officer will discuss
							the issue with his manager and director, as required for a decision. If the client considers
							that the decision rendered is not appropriate, the client may refer the issue with their
							respective Acquisitions Account Manager in the Client Engagement Directorate. Although, the
							Account Managers do not make the final decision, they will carefully assess the issue with
							the director responsible for that standing offer or supply arrangement, in order to arrive
							at a clear and timely resolution.</li>
						<li>The contracting officer should record all procurements where an applicable mandatory
							standing offer or supply arrangement was not used, and the associated
							reason(s).<br><strong>Note 1</strong>: Departments can not put their own standing offers or
							supply arrangements in place, so as to avoid having to use <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> standing offers or
							supply arrangements, as this would defeat the long term benefits and savings of the <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> government wide
							approach.<br><strong>Note 2</strong>: If a lower price is available for an equivalent good
							or service, by means other than the mandatory standing offer or supply arrangement, the
							client department is requested to inform the <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting officer
							responsible for the appropriate standing offer or supply arrangement (the one that the

					<ol type="a">
						<li>An Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN) is a public notice indicating to the supplier
							community that a department or agency intends to award a good, service or construction
							contract to a pre-identified supplier, believed to be the only one capable of performing the
							work, thereby allowing other suppliers to signal their interest in bidding by submitting a
							statement of capabilities. If no other supplier submits a statement of capabilities that
							meets the requirements set out in the <abbr
								title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>, the contracting officer may then
							proceed with awarding the contract to the pre-identified supplier. It is important to note
							that an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> is not a
							&quot;competitive&quot; process. Also of note is that an <abbr
								title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> process, even if conducted in
							accordance with the Policy, does not constitute a &quot;competitive&quot; process for the
							purposes of the trade agreements and any Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)
							challenge. For the purposes of contract approval authorities only, a contract awarded after
							posting an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> for which no valid
							statement of capabilities is submitted within the notice period is a competitive
							(electronic) contract.</li>
						<li>The objectives of the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> process are
							to:<ol type="i">
								<li>provide a procurement process that is efficient and cost effective while being fair,
									open and transparent;</li>
								<li>provide potential suppliers with the opportunity to demonstrate, by way of a

									out in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>; and</li>
								<li>respect the principles of government contracting by enhancing fairness, access and
									transparency.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>To provide transparency to the procurement process, an <abbr
								title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> can be used only when there is

							<cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/FullText.html"
									rel="external">Government Contracts Regulations</a></cite> (GCRs) and, if

							agreements. (See <a href="#section-3.15">3.15 Non-competitive Contracting Process</a> and <a
								href="#section-3.15.1">3.15.1 Justification of Non-competitive Process</a>)</li>
						<li>The <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> notice must be published on the

								<li>a procurement plan or Contract Plan and Advance Approval (CPAA), as applicable, is
									placed on the procurement file before an <abbr

								<li>the pre-identified supplier meets the same criteria to be used for assessment of
									other suppliers who submit statements of capabilities; and</li>
								<li>the procedures provided in <a href="#section-3.15">3.15 Non-competitive Contracting

								appropriate and an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> would not be
								posted.</li>
							<li>When invoking exception 6(d) of the <abbr

					<li>An urgent requirement (acquisition) is one that calls for immediate action and conveys a sense
						of urgency. The contracting officer will decide, in consultation with the client and <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> management as required, if
						the requirement is to be treated as an urgent acquisition. Defining an acquisition as urgent
						will depend on the current client department&#39;s priorities as well as government priorities
						as a whole. For example, an urgent requirement may be defined as those acquisitions where an
						undue delay could have a significant economic impact, an effect on health and safety programs,
						or a risk of not meeting an important project/program milestone.</li>
					<li>In most cases, it is important that <abbr

					<li>When the requirement has been identified as urgent, the following strategies may be
						utilized:<br>
						<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and the client
								should use an integrated team approach with dedicated personnel working closely with the

								should be given to having a single point of contact in each department to coordinate all
								of the acquisitions.</li>
							<li>early development of sound communication channels is crucial, involving all
								stakeholders. Urgent requirements will be given priority attention, and concurrent
								review processes should be established and used whenever possible.</li>
							<li>contracting officers should provide information to the industry as early as possible in
								the process, using such pre-solicitation tools as Request for Information (RFI),
								Solicitation of Interest and Qualification (SOIQ), and Price and Availability Enquiries
								(P&amp;A), where appropriate. For more information on the use of these tools, see 4.5.
							</li>
							<li>in cases where Treasury Board project approval is required but has not yet been obtained

					<ol start="1" type="a">

					<h2><a id="section-3.25">3.25 Trade agreements tendering approaches</a></h2>
					<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2021-05-20</time>)</p>
				</header>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>There are three tendering approaches under trade agreements: open tendering, selective
						tendering, and limited tendering.<ol type="i">
							<li>Open Tendering: Where a Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP) is published and any
								supplier may submit a bid;<p>Open Tendering is the preferred approach.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Selective Tendering: May involve the use of a one-time list of prequalified suppliers or
								the use of a permanent list of prequalified suppliers. When using selective tendering,
								all prequalified suppliers must be allowed to participate in a procurement, unless the
								procuring entity states in its request for prequalification any limitation on the number
								of suppliers that will be permitted to tender and the criteria for selecting the limited
								number of suppliers.<p>Procedural obligations relating to prequalification that appear
									in trade agreements under the heading of &quot;selective tendering&quot; are applied
									at <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> as
									follows. Note that where a procurement is subject to any of the trade agreements, an
									<abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr> must be published at both
									stages of the process.</p>
								<p>Trade agreement obligations relating to prequalification are applied as set out
									below:</p>
								<ol type="A">
									<li>
										<p>Involving the use of a one-time list of prequalified suppliers:</p>
										<p>This is a two stage procurement process, where the first stage involves the
											publication of an <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr>
											where potential interested suppliers meet predetermined qualifications for
											participation. In the second stage, tender documentation is issued to the
											prequalified suppliers determined during the first stage.</p>
										<p>For procurements subject to one or more international trade agreements, an
											<abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr> must be published at
											both stages of the procurement (it is also acceptable to amend the original
											<abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr> once the tender
											closing date has been determined);</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Involving the use of a permanent list of prequalified suppliers *:</p>
										<p>An <abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr> is published and
											potential interested suppliers meet predetermined qualifications for
											participation. A list of prequalified suppliers is then developed,
											maintained, and used for several different individual solicitation
											processes.</p>
										<p>For the individual solicitation processes done under the list, prequalified
											suppliers are issued the tender documentation. Any other potential supplier
											who requests tender documentation must be considered, as long as there is
											sufficient time to carry out the prequalification process. For lists subject
											to the <abbr title="Canadian Free Trade Agreement">CFTA</abbr> and/or one or
											more international trade agreements, an annual notice of the existence of
											the permanent list of prequalified suppliers must be published on <abbr
												title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr> (use the
											<abbr title="Notice of Proposed Procurement">NPP</abbr> form).</p>
										<p>At <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>,
											obligations regarding permanent lists of prequalified suppliers are
											operationalized as Supply Arrangements.</p>
										<p>*A permanent list of qualified suppliers may also be referred to as a
											&quot;source list&quot;, and is also referred to in many trade agreements as
											a &quot;multi-use list&quot;.</p>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Limited Tendering: A tendering approach where, in specific circumstances, a contracting
								officer may choose to deviate from certain procedural obligations of the applicable
								trade agreement(s) in a particular procurement.<p>Limited tendering must not be used to
									avoid competition between suppliers, to discriminate against suppliers, or to
									protect domestic suppliers. Trade agreement rules regarding technical specifications
									must still be followed. The default approach when limited tendering is a competitive
									process; however, where appropriate, limited tendering may be non-competitive or
									used for sole sourcing. In all cases, it is recommended that contracting officers
									continue to follow the procedural obligations of the trade agreements to the
									greatest extent possible and only choose to deviate from procedural obligations as
									permitted and as needed.</p>
								<p>Where more than one trade agreement applies, an appropriate limited tendering
									justification must be found in the limited tendering provision of each agreement,
									and the reference to the procedural obligations the contracting officer may choose
									to deviate from must also be found in the limited tendering provision of each
									agreement.</p>
								<p>In general, by following the limited tendering obligations set out in the <abbr
										title="World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</abbr>
									and <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr>,
									contracting officers will meet the requirements for the other trade agreements.
									However, for the greatest certainty, contracting officers should refer to the
									limited tendering provisions found in the applicable trade agreements. For examples
									of limited tendering provisions, see:</p>
								<ol type="A">
									<li>Article 513: Limited Tendering of Chapter 5 of the <a
											href="https://www.cfta-alec.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CFTA-Consolidated-Text-Final-Print-Text-English.pdf"
											rel="external"><abbr title="Canadian Free Trade Agreement">CFTA</abbr></a>;
									</li>
									<li>Article 19.12 – Limited tendering of <a

											rel="external">Article XIII – Limited Tendering</a> of the <abbr
											title="World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</abbr>.
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>A summary of the limited tendering reasons found in the trade agreements, as well as
									of the procedural obligations a contracting officer may choose to deviate from when
									using limited tendering can be found in <a href="#annex-3.2">Annex 3.2: Limited
										tendering reasons contained in the trade agreements</a>.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>For the procedure for publication on <abbr
							title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>, see <a
							href="#section-4.75.20">4.75.20 Procedure for posting of Notice of Proposed Procurement on
							Government Electronic Tendering Service</a>.</li>
					<li>In addition to the above tendering procedures, Crown corporations may use a notice of planned
						procurement to advertise potential procurements. This notice is normally published at the start
						of a fiscal year and lists potential procurements for the enterprise in the upcoming fiscal
						year.<p>A response from potential suppliers to a notice of planned procurement is not required.
						</p>
						<p>For Crowns, the notice of planned procurement may also be used as a notice regarding a
							prequalification process. When used in this manner, a response from suppliers would be
							required. Tender documentation is issued to those suppliers meeting the prequalifications.

						<p>The Treasury Board Directive on <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17060"

								rel="external">2008 December Report of the Auditor General of Canada</a>, the Office of
							the Auditor General raised the issue of separation of duties with respect to task

							responsibility of one individual was not in keeping with the Treasury Board Policy on
							Delegation of Authorities. As a result, although task authorizations are not individual
							contracts, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> applies

							the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> individual who

					<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2022-05-02</time>)</p>
				</header>
				<ol class="double-space" type="a">
					<li>A standing offer (SO) is an offer from a supplier to Canada that allows Canada to purchase goods
						and/or services, or a combination of goods and services, as and when requested, during a
						specific period of time, through the use of a call-up process which incorporates the conditions
						and pricing of the standing offer.</li>
					<li>A standing offer itself is not a contract. A separate contract is formed each time a call-up for
						the provision of goods and/or services is made against a standing offer. When a call-up is made,
						it constitutes an unconditional acceptance by Canada of the supplier&#39;s offer for the
						provision, to the extent specified, of the goods and/or services described in the standing
						offer. Canada&#39;s liability is limited to the actual value of the call-ups made by the
						identified user(s) within the period the standing offer is valid.</li>
					<li>This method of supply is used to satisfy the requirements of departments and agencies for a
						specified period, when precise details on expected quantities for the period are not known in
						advance. Standing offers may authorize one or more clients to issue call-ups for goods or
						services directly to offerors up to the maximum call-up limits indicated in the standing offer.
						If so stated in the standing offer, <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> may issue call-ups above
						the client call-up limit.</li>
					<li>For a description of the five types of standing offers that may be authorized, see <a
							href="#section-7.10.1">7.10.1 Standing Offers</a>.</li>
					<li>A standing offer may be valid for one or more years. The selection of the appropriate time
						period is a process that varies significantly by individual commodity.</li>
					<li>The quantity of goods and/or level of services specified in the Request for Standing Offers
						(RFSO) and the resulting standing offer(s) are only an approximation of the requirements given
						in good faith by Canada to the offerors.</li>
					<li>All government policies, regulations and procedures related to contracting, including those
						required under the trade agreements, apply to the standing offer method of supply.</li>
					<li>The total estimated expenditure of the requirement (the anticipated total value of all
						accumulated call-ups) proposed to be satisfied by the standing offer method of supply, Goods and
						Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) included, must be used to determine the
						applicability of any procedures required by any trade agreement to which the Government of
						Canada is signatory. If it is intended to issue more than one standing offer against the <abbr
							title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSO</abbr>, the sum of the total estimated value, <abbr
							title="Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax">GST/HST</abbr> included, of all
						resulting standing offers must be used to obtain approval.</li>
					<li>Contracting officers should consider using a standing offer where appropriate considering the
						advantages and disadvantages of the approach:<ol class="double-space" type="A">
							<li>Advantages of a standing offer method of supply may include:<ol class="double-space">
									<li>improved client service (with a standing offer in place, clients can place
										orders quickly);</li>
									<li>reducing the risk of overestimating the need.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Disadvantages of a standing offer approach may include:<ol class="double-space">
									<li>supply that is not guaranteed at that price since the offeror may withdraw;</li>
									<li>prices that may be less competitive.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Standing offers may be either competitive (see Standard Acquisition Clauses and ConditionsManual
						<a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/1/2006">standard
							instructions 2006</a>) or non-competitive (see <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/1/2007">standard
							instructions 2007</a>) in nature.</li>
					<li>For more information on the competitive solicitation process for <abbr
							title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSO</abbr>s, see <a href="#section-4">Chapter 4 -
							Solicitation Process</a>.</li>
					<li>A standing offer may be directed on a non-competitive basis to one offeror for its full range of
						catalogue goods or services. The non-competitive approval authorities would then apply.</li>
					<li>The standing offer is usually considered for goods and services when:<ol class="double-space"
							type="A">
							<li>One or more clients repetitively order(s) the same range of goods, services, or both,
								and the actual demand (for example, quantity, delivery date, delivery point) is not
								known in advance;</li>
							<li>Some of the following conditions are present:<ol class="double-space">
									<li>the goods, services, or both are well defined;</li>
									<li>pre-arranged prices or a prearranged pricing basis can be established at the
										outset, usually through competition, and there is no need nor any intention to
										negotiate them at the time of the call-up;</li>
									<li>the goods and services, or both are readily available and are to be ordered
										(requested through a call-up), if and when the requirements arise, and</li>
									<li>at the time of the call-up, there is no need, nor any intention to further
										negotiate contractual terms and conditions.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The standing offer method of supply cannot be used when:<ol class="double-space" type="A">
							<li>prices, pricing basis or conditions are not stated, or are subject to change at any time
								at the discretion of the supplier;</li>
							<li>the identified users of the standing offers intend to negotiate further the prearranged
								prices, pricing basis, or conditions of the standing offer, or</li>
							<li>it is intended to solicit bids each time goods or services are required. In these cases,
								another method of supply such as a supply arrangement should be considered.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Departments and agencies are authorized by <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to make call-ups against
						each standing offer, as defined in the standing offer. See paragraph (a) under subsection <a
							href="#section-4.10.20.1">4.10.20.1 Standing Offer Procedures</a>.</li>
					<li>When procedural requirements of any trade agreement apply to a standing offer method of supply,
						the complete procurement process, including all standing offers authorized for use and the
						resulting call-ups, fall within the purview of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal.</li>
					<li>
						<p>If a Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) and the resulting call-ups include a security
							requirement, contracting officers should consider how the security requirements will be
							managed (i.e. what the base security requirements will be and how different security
							requirements such as Information Technology (IT), Production and/or <abbr
								title="Communications Security">COMSEC</abbr> are managed). The contracting officer must
							ensure that a call-up issued against a Standing Offer contains the appropriate security
							requirements and that the client is aware of their responsibility to confirm the security
							status of the organization/personnel prior to issuing the call-up.</p>
						<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> When security capabilities such as document safeguarding, <abbr
								title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> (including cloud computing), Productions and/or
							<abbr title="Communications Security">COMSEC</abbr> are required, seek assurance of these
							specific security types from the Contract Security Program (CSP) as they are
							contract-specific. Contracting officers must send copies of all such call-ups to the <abbr

					<li>To strengthen the integrity of procurement and to ensure that the Government does business with
						ethical suppliers in Canada and abroad, the Government of Canada implemented a government-wide
						<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/ci-if-eng.html" rel="external">Integrity Regime</a>
						for procurement and real property transactions. The Regime fosters ethical business practices,
						ensures due process for suppliers and upholds the public trust in the procurement process. It is
						transparent, rigorous and consistent with best practices in Canada and abroad, while supporting
						transparent competition and an ethical Canadian marketplace.</li>
					<li>The Integrity Regime is administered by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC)
						under the authority of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-38.2/"
							rel="external"><cite>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</cite></a>, the
						<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/" rel="external"><cite>Financial
								Administration Act</cite></a> as well as through the operation of various Memoranda of
						Understanding that have been concluded with other government departments, agencies and certain
						crown corporations. The Integrity Regime consists of the <a

					<li>The Government of Canada may enter into contracts with bidders, offerors or suppliers that would
						otherwise be ineligible to be awarded a contract or suspended through mechanisms provided in the
						Integrity Regime (i.e. Public Interest Exceptions and Administrative Agreements). Additional

					<li>Contracts with former public servants in receipt of a pension or of a lump sum payment must bear

					<li>A former public servant is any former member of a department as defined in the <cite><a
								href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/" rel="external">Financial
								Administration Act</a></cite>, a former member of the Canadian Armed Forces or a former

					<li>Workforce Adjustment Directive<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>In addition to the requirements of the contract fee abatement policy for former public

								Canadian Forces, and members of the <abbr
									title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</abbr>, who have received a lump sum
								payment for employment termination under a workforce reduction program or adjustment
								initiative, has been limited during the lump sum payment period.</li>
							<li>Contract fee limits should otherwise not apply if the contract is not specifically for
								the services of a former public servant.</li>
							<li>Historically, the &quot;<dfn>lump sum payment period</dfn>&quot; is defined as the
								period measured in weeks of salary, for which payment has been made to facilitate the
								transition to retirement or to other employment as a result of the implementation of
								various programs to reduce the size of the Public Service. The lump sum payment period
								did not include the period of severance pay, which is measured in a like manner.</li>
							<li>For non-competitive service contracts awarded to a former public servant during the lump
								sum payment period, the total amount of fees that may be paid, may be limited by the
								terms of a workforce adjustment made pursuant to the Directive, including applicable
								taxes. The contract fee limit policy applies to all former public servants, including
								former members of the Canadian Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in receipt
								of a lump sum payment.</li>
							<li>Reasonable overhead costs, such as travel expenses must be excluded from any prescribed
								limit. Nevertheless, due to the sensitivity of these contracts, these costs should be
								strictly controlled. Minister approval must be sought prior to entering into a
								non-competitive contract with a former public servant, if they are in receipt of a lump
								sum payment when the total fees payable will exceed $5,000 during the lump sum payment
								period as provided in the <cite>Workforce Reduction Directive</cite> made pursuant to
								the <cite>Public Sector Compensation Act</cite>, or former members of the Canadian Armed
								Forces or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in receipt of lump sum payments through
								corresponding force reduction programs, regardless of whether one or more than one

				<ol class="double-space" type="a">
					<li>Before issuing a solicitation or awarding a contract, the contracting officer must identify what
						Intellectual Property (IP) is already existing before contract award and, conversely, what
						Intellectual Property (IP) will be generated as a result of the contract. In addition to
						reducing future costs, disputes can be avoided by being clear upfront.</li>
					<li><abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> is anything resulting from a contract that can be
						copyrighted, trademarked, patented, licensed, etc. Potentially, any contract can have <abbr
							title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>. The likelihood for <abbr
							title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> is much greater where the goal of the contract is
						something new, or might incorporate new processes. <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>
						considerations are most relevant to research and development contracts, software development, or
						where the production of new written material occurs. A definition of &quot;Intellectual
						Property&quot; and Intellectual Property Rights&quot; can be found in Standard Acquisition
						Clauses and Conditions Manual general conditions <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/2040/active">2040</a>.
					</li>
					<li>Contracting officers can find complete details on the <abbr
							title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> policy as per following Treasury Board policies:<ol
							class="double-space" type="i">
							<li><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13697&amp;section=html"
									rel="external">Policy on Title to Intellectual Property Arising Under Crown
									Procurement Contracts</a></li>

									rel="external">Implementation Guide for the Policy: Title to Intellectual Property
									Arising Under Crown Procurement Contracts</a>.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The default position of the government policy is to allow contractors to retain the rights to
						<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> generated under government contracts. This is
						designed to promote the commercialization of new ideas, under the premise that the private
						sector has a greater capacity in this regard. Exceptions are described in the Policy references
						above.</li>
					<li>The contracting officer must therefore determine at the planning stage, how <abbr
							title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> will be handled, what <abbr
							title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> is anticipated and how the <abbr
							title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> will be identified and secured for the use of the
						client and Canada. Once again, this process can have very long timeframes and can have extremely
						complex processes. The greatest pitfall with <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> is in
						not identifying what is the foreground information and the background information upfront and if
						left to the end of the contract, Canada is at a severe disadvantage.</li>
					<li>The client department must decide to what extent <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>
						rights are to be retained by Canada. However, the contracting officer should discuss with the
						client department their needs in order to ensure that the client department is aware of the
						extent to which <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> can
						obtain for them the rights they need to use the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>
						created under their contract, whether Canada or the contractor owns the <abbr
							title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>. For instance, subject to industry practice, Canada
						may not be able to obtain <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> ownership, even when
						desired. In such cases, Public Works and Government Services Canada ( <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>) contract clauses are
						designed with the goal of ensuring that even where the contractor owns the <abbr
							title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>, this does not affect the client department&#39;s
						ability to use the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>, except that such use would not
						extend to commercialization of the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> by Canada.</li>

						<li>A request must be in the form of a letter from the responsible <abbr

						<li>In reviewing requests to invoke the <abbr title="National Security Exception">NSE</abbr>,

							Once the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister of the Acquisitions Program">ADM/AP</abbr>
							has made a decision whether or not to invoke an <abbr

						<li>Following the invocation of an <abbr title="National Security Exception">NSE</abbr>, the
							contracting officer must state in all procurement documents that an <abbr

					<li>All Legal Services lawyers are officers of the Department of Justice. The role of the <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Legal Services is to
						provide legal services to <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>. Legal services relating to
						procurement must be sought only from the <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Legal Services or from a
						regional office of Justice Canada, when the latter has agreed along with <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Legal Services to provide
						counsel to a particular region. Legal Services involvement in the review of proposed contractual
						documents is intended to:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>ensure that contracts are legally binding and enforceable and precisely reflect the
								intended relationship between Canada and the contractor;</li>
							<li>ensure that the respective obligations of the parties are expressed clearly and that the
								interest of Canada are protected;</li>
							<li>identify the consequences of any changes to standard general conditions in terms of the
								additional risk and liability being assumed by Canada.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Whenever legal involvement is required, contracting officers must provide the legal counsel
						involved with access to all required documents and files. Legal counsels should be given the
						opportunity to review procurement documents at an early stage in the procurement process to
						facilitate the making of informed business decisions and incorporation of any required changes.
						For the procurement of goods and services, this means before the issuance of bid solicitations
						and requests for standing offers or for supply arrangements. For anything related to the
						administration of the contract, standing offer or supply arrangement, Legal Services must be
						consulted before any binding action is taken by contracting officers.</li>
					<li>Contracting officers must seek legal advice:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>if determined through the application of a procurement risk assessment;</li>
							<li>for contracts containing special conditions or deviations from <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> or Canadian
								Commercial Corporation general and supplemental conditions;</li>
							<li>in all situations where the work has been completed pursuant to a verbal request from a
								representative of a client and a confirming order has to be prepared;</li>
							<li>in all situations where a security must be obtained to ensure repayment of a debt or
								satisfaction of an obligation to Canada, particularly for all contracts under which
								payment is secured by means of a letter of credit;</li>
							<li>for all letters of comfort, letters of intent and go-ahead letters;</li>
							<li>for all contracts where questions may arise regarding conflict of interest issues or the
								post-employment code for former public servants;</li>
							<li>for all letters of credit;</li>
							<li>for any proposed assignment of a contract to a third party;</li>
							<li>for any case of receivership, insolvency or bankruptcy of a contractor;</li>
							<li>for all terminations for default, convenience and mutual consent;</li>
							<li>for all defence contracts where the provisions of section 20 of the <cite><a
										href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-1/" rel="external">Defence
										Production Act</a></cite> respecting title to any government issue or building
								may be applicable;</li>
							<li>for all memorandum of understanding and drafting of orders in council;</li>
							<li>for all conditional amendments (see <a href="#section-8.180">8.180 Vendor Performance
									Corrective Measure Policy</a>).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Legal Services can also be contacted about any matter in respect of which a contracting officer
						believes legal advice would be appropriate or helpful. Some of these situations are identified
						below:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>any proposed contract for services involving the possible development of an
								employee-employer relationship;</li>
							<li>any proposed contract where a clause providing for liquidated damages must be included
								to cover late delivery or unsatisfactory performance of the work;</li>
							<li>disputes arising after the contract has been awarded;</li>
							<li>for discussions or communications with outside lawyers.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Solicitor-Client Privilege<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>Communications between a client and its lawyer are protected by the solicitor-client
								privilege and exempt from disclosure under the <cite><a
										href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/" rel="external">Access to
										Information Act</a></cite>. The solicitor-client privilege allows clients to
								disclose all relevant information to their legal counsel knowing that such information
								will remain confidential. There are however three conditions for the privilege to apply:
								<ol class="double-space" type="A">
									<li>the communication must be with a practicing lawyer occupying a legal counsel
										position within government (it would also include a non-government lawyer hired
										by the Department of Justice to provide legal services in certain
										circumstances);</li>
									<li>the communication must be for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice,
										as opposed to policy advice or non legal matters advice;</li>
									<li>the request for legal advice and any advice given must have been intended to be
										confidential. A notice &quot;protected by solicitor-client privilege&quot; may
										not be sufficient to prove that the parties intended that the communication be
										privileged. The proof will really be found from the actions of the client who
										must disclose the communication only to those persons who have a direct need to
										know depending on the circumstances of each case. Contracting officers must be
										particularly careful with e-mails containing legal advice and not forward them
										to persons who don&#39;t have a direct need to know.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>All three conditions must be met for the privilege to apply. If any one of those
								conditions is not met, all communications between the lawyer and the client relating to
								the subject matter will lose their privilege status.</li>
							<li>The solicitor-client privilege is the privilege of the client, who alone can waive it
								either intentionally or unintentionally. Intentional waiver occurs when a client, after
								consultation with its legal counsel, decides to disclose the privileged communications
								knowing the consequences of this action. Unintentional waiver occurs when, despite the
								fact that the parties still intend to keep the communication confidential, it is
								disclosed to a third party who does not have the need to know. Once the communication is
								revealed to a third party who does not have a need to know, the privilege is waived.
								This means that the legal advice is not protected anymore and is subject to disclosure
								under the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/"
										rel="external">Access to Information Act</a></cite>, if no other exception
								applies. This also means that all other communications between the legal counsel and the
								client relating to the same subject may lose their privilege and protection.</li>
							<li>Communications subject to solicitor-client privilege can be subject to mandatory
								statutory disclosure. For example, the <cite><a
										href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-17/" rel="external">Auditor
										General Act</a></cite> authorizes the Auditor General to review legal advice on
								matters relevant to her/his auditing function. The Auditor General however cannot
								disclose the legal advice. The disclosure to the Auditor General does not constitute a
								waiver of the privilege and the information remains confidential and is still protected
								by the privilege.</li>
							<li>Legal advice should not be disclosed without the knowledge and recommendation of legal
								counsel. All questions regarding solicitor-client privilege should be brought to the
								attention of Legal Services.</li>

				</header>
				<ol start="1" type="a">
					<li>A bidders&#39; conference is used to provide information to suppliers and to ensure that all
						suppliers receive the same information. A conference must be held only when such a meeting is
						required for suppliers to fully understand the proposed procurement.</li>
					<li>Supplier’s attendance is optional, as the purpose of a bidder’s conference is to provide
						information and opportunities for bidders to ask questions about the project and the procurement
						process, which can easily be done via e-mail if an interested bidder does not attend the
						conference. Only the information that was shared with the attendees at the bidders’ conference
						must be shared with bidders who did not attend.</li>
					<li>Whenever there is a bidders&#39; conference planned, the Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP)
						and solicitation documents must clearly state that there will be a bidder&#39;s conference and
						indicate the location, date and time and the level of clearance required (if the location
						requires that participants hold a valid security clearance).</li>
					<li>SACC Manual clause <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/A/A9083T/active">A9083T</a>
						should be used when a bidders’ conference will be held and to provide the necessary instructions
						for attendance. Clause A9083T must also be used to provide location, time and administrative
						arrangements of the bidders&#39; conference in the solicitation document. For Request for
						Standing Offers, the equivalent <abbr
							title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> clause is <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/M/M9083T/active">M9083T</a>.

					</li>
					<li>The bidders&#39; conference normally takes place at the Public Works and Government Services
						Canada (PWGSC) office that issues the solicitation, or at another suitable location arranged by
						that office. It is preferable to choose a location accessible to the public so the bidders are
						not required to hold a valid security clearance or be escorted by a government representative.
					</li>
					<li>While a bidders&#39; conference is normally held as one meeting, the scope of the solicitation
						may dictate the need for a series of cross-country regional conferences.</li>
					<li>The conference should be scheduled on a date that will:<ol start="1" type="i">
							<li>allow suppliers time to obtain and review the solicitation;</li>
							<li>allow for the preparation and distribution of minutes in sufficient time for suppliers
								to prepare and submit bids before the solicitation closing date;</li>
							<li>allow for bidders to obtain the required security clearance.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The contracting officer should request in the solicitation document that suppliers identify, in
						writing, before the meeting date, the names of the representatives who will attend and a list of
						the issues they propose to raise.</li>
					<li>Before the conference, the contracting officer must prepare an agenda outlining elements to be
						discussed, including questions raised by suppliers. <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> will chair all bidders&#39;
						conferences and prepare the minutes, including any clarifications or specification changes that
						may result in a change to the requirement. Client departments are also expected to attend and be
						available to answer any questions relating to the requirement.</li>
					<li>The minutes of the bidder’s conference must be made available to all attendees in sufficient
						time to allow suppliers to prepare and submit responses before the solicitation closing date.
						For solicitation documents originally posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service
						(GETS), the minutes must also be posted on <abbr
							title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>; for solicitations that are not
						posted on <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>, the minutes must be
						made available to all suppliers who have already requested a solicitation document or have been
						invited to respond to the solicitation. The sensitivity of the information included in the
						minutes has to be considered when choosing the proper way of making them available.</li>
					<li>Any clarifications or changes to the solicitation resulting from the bidders&#39; conference
						will be included as an amendment to the solicitation. A copy of the solicitation amendments must
						be made available on <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr> or, if
						the solicitation has not been posted on <abbr
							title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>, to all suppliers who have
						already requested a solicitation document or have been invited to respond to the solicitation.
					</li>
					<li>Where practical, the use of various technical means such as video conferencing, teleconferencing
						or web casting could be considered to allow suppliers to participate either directly or
						indirectly to the conference. Video or audio recordings of the conference could be made and
						distributed to suppliers who were not able to attend; it is however not recommended to permit
						suppliers to record the conference for their own purposes.</li>
					<li>Suppliers that do not attend the bidder’s conference are not precluded from submitting a bid.

				<ol type="a">
					<li>The Canadian Content Policy is a Cabinet-mandated policy. It encourages industrial development
						in Canada by limiting, in specific circumstances, competition for government procurement
						opportunities to suppliers of Canadian goods and services.</li>
					<li>Application<ol type="i">
							<li>The Policy applies to procurements carried out by Supply and Services Canada, which is
								now a part of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC). Therefore, this
								policy will normally apply to goods and services contracting carried out by <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Acquisitions
								Branch, except for those categories of procurements which were not done by the former
								SSC. The Policy does not apply when another government department does its own
								contracting and would not normally apply to construction procurement that had been
								previously carried out by the former Public Works Canada.<br>In addition, pursuant to a
								Cabinet decision, the Department of National Defence must apply the Canadian Content
								Policy to all applicable transactions or orders when buying or otherwise acquiring
								defence supplies.</li>
							<li>The Policy applies to competitive procurements with an estimated value of $25,000 or
								more, except for the following:<ol type="A">
									<li>government procurements subject to the international trade agreements;</li>
									<li>procurements made in furtherance of aid to developing countries, but does apply
										to purchases made by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) on its
										own account;</li>
									<li>procurements made by <abbr
											title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>
										Acquisitions offices located outside Canada; and</li>
									<li>other Cabinet-mandated sourcing, including sourcing related to industrial and
										regional benefits, shipbuilding, ship repair, refit and mid-life modernization.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Canadian Goods and Services<ol type="i">
							<li>A good wholly manufactured or originating in Canada is considered a Canadian good. A
								product containing imported components may also be considered Canadian for the purpose
								of this policy when it has undergone sufficient change in Canada in a manner that
								satisfies the definition specified under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement
								(CUSMA) Rules of Origin. For the purposes of the Canadian Content Policy, the reference
								to &quot;territory of one or more of the Parties&quot; in the <abbr
									title="Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement">CUSMA</abbr> Rules of Origin is to be
								replaced with &quot;Canada&quot;.</li>
							<li>A service provided by an individual based in Canada is considered a Canadian service.
								Where a requirement consists of only one service, which is being provided by more than
								one individual, the service will be considered Canadian if a minimum of 80 percent of
								the total bid price for the service is provided by individuals based in Canada.</li>
							<li>Other Canadian Goods and Services: Textiles are considered to be Canadian goods
								according to a modified rule of origin, copies of which are available from the Clothing
								and Textiles Division, Commercial and Consumer Products Directorate (CCPD).</li>
							<li>For further information on the determination of origin of goods and/or services under

									Policy: Rules of Origin Determination</a>.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Preparing a Bid Solicitation<ol type="i">
							<li>When a requirement is covered by the Canadian Content Policy, the contracting officer
								must first determine whether there are two or more eligible suppliers in the
								marketplace. Eligible suppliers are those supplying Canadian goods and/or services that
								could potentially meet the requirement.</li>
							<li>Next, based on the number of eligible suppliers, the contracting officer must decide
								whether a requirement will be solely or conditionally limited to suppliers of Canadian
								goods and/or services, or whether the procurement will be open to all suppliers.<ol
									type="A">
									<li>Solely Limited: the bid solicitation or request for standing offers will be
										solely limited to suppliers who could offer Canadian goods and/or services when
										the contracting officer believes there exists, in the marketplace, two or more
										such suppliers.<ol type="a">

								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Once the sourcing strategy is determined, the contracting officer will prepare a Notice

									<li>Solely Limited, Code O-5;</li>
									<li>Conditionally Limited, Code O-4; or</li>
									<li>Open, Code O-1.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Where a procurement is subject to the Canadian Content Policy, and the competition has
								been solely or conditionally limited, the bidder must certify the Canadian content by
								submitting a certification that the good or service offered meets the definition of
								Canadian goods and/or services.<ol type="A">
									<li>When requirements consist of more than one good and/or service, the contracting
										officer must decide, at the procurement planning stage, whether the Canadian
										content certification will be done on an aggregate or individual basis:<ol
											type="a">
											<li>aggregate: multi-item requirements will be certified on an aggregate
												basis. A minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price must consist of
												Canadian goods to meet the requirements of the Policy; or</li>
											<li>item by Item: multi-item requirements awarded on an item by item basis
												will be certified on an item-by-item basis. In these cases, suppliers
												will be asked to identify separately, each item that meets the
												definition of Canadian goods.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>For requirements consisting of more than one service, a minimum of 80 percent of
										the total bid price must be provided by individuals based in Canada.</li>
									<li>For requirements consisting of a mix of goods and services, 80 percent of the
										total bid price must consist of Canadian goods and Canadian services. See <a
											href="#section-3">Annex 3.6: Canadian Content Policy: Rules of Origin
											Determination</a> for an example of how to determine whether a mix of goods
										and services meets the 80 percent rule.</li>
									<li>A bid can be accepted in part without resubmission of a certification.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Bid Handling<ol type="i">
							<li>The supplier is responsible to demonstrate that its bid meets the definition of Canadian

									<li>If the procurement process was solely limited to Canadian goods and/or services,
										and<ol type="a">
											<li>the bidder was required to submit the certification with the bid, only
												bids with a valid certification will be evaluated. The bid evaluation
												process can proceed where there is at least one bid with a valid
												certification otherwise the bid solicitation must be reissued; or</li>
											<li>the bidder was not required to submit the certification with the bid,
												the contracting officer will contact the bidder and provide the bidder
												with a timeframe within which to submit the completed certification. If
												the bidder does not comply by submitting the completed certification
												within the prescribed timeframe, the bid will be declared
												non-responsive. A bid will only be provided to the client department for
												evaluation once the completed certification is received. The bid
												evaluation process can continue as long as there is at least one bid
												with a valid certification otherwise the bid solicitation must be
												reissued.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>If the procurement process was conditionally limited to Canadian goods and/or
											services, the contracting officer will determine if there are two or more
											bids that come from two or more bidders that are not affiliated within the
											meaning used in the <a
												href="https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/index.html"
												rel="external"><cite>Competition Act</cite></a>, <abbr
												title="Revised Statutes of Canada">R.S.C.</abbr>, 1985, <abbr
												title="chapter">c.</abbr> C-34, with a valid Canadian content
											certification. It is recommended that contracting officers make this
											determination as the first step in the evaluation process; however,
											contracting officers may conduct the validation of Canadian content
											certifications at any time in the evaluation process including concurrently
											with other steps.</p>
										<p>In the event two or more bids with a valid Canadian content certification
											have been received from two or more unaffiliated bidders, the evaluation
											will be limited to the bids with the certification, and only those bids with
											a valid certification will be eligible to be awarded the contract. If fewer
											than two bids from two unaffiliated bidders with a valid Canadian content
											certification are received, then all bids will be evaluated and are eligible
											to be awarded the contract. If at any point in the evaluation process it is
											found, whether by determination of invalidity of certifications,
											determination that bids are non-responsive or withdrawal of bids by bidders,
											that there are no longer two or more responsive bids coming from two or more
											unaffiliated suppliers with a valid certification, then all responsive bids
											will be eligible to be awarded a contract. (See <abbr

				<p>Life cycle costing pertains to all four stages of the procurement process, from planning and
					acquisition to use and disposal. Currently, the Policy on Green Procurement applies to all federal
					government procurement activities. The Policy requires that environmental performance considerations
					be embedded into the procurement decision-making process in the same manner as price, performance,
					quality and availability. For more information and tools on the life cycle costing, see  <a
						href="#section-2.20">2.20 Green Procurement and Defining the Requirement</a>.</p>

					</header>
					<ol class="double-space" type="a">
						<li>The Policy on Green Procurement is aligned with the Treasury Board (TB) policies on assets
							and acquired services and reinforces the requirement to take into account both environmental
							performance and costs that occur throughout the life cycle of assets and acquired services,
							including planning, acquisition, use and disposal. Some cost elements related to
							environmental factors that could be taken into account in assessing value for money in the
							evaluation of bids, offers or arrangements include:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
								<li>operation costs, such as energy or water consumed by the product over its life;</li>
								<li>indirect costs (less energy efficient information technology equipment will produce
									more heat causing the building&#39;s air conditioning system to work harder, and
									increase electricity costs);</li>
								<li>administrative costs, such as complying to Workplace Hazardous Materials Information
									System (WHMIS);</li>
								<li>investing up front to save costs later, such as specifying higher levels of
									insulation where the extra expenditure can be recovered from lower energy costs;
								</li>
								<li>cost of disposal arrangements;</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The application of total life cycle costing has traditionally meant the sum of the Product,
							Resource, Operating, and Contingent (PROC) costs relating to procurement. The <abbr
								title="Product, Resource, Operating, and Contingent">PROC</abbr> technique is essential
							for evaluating bids, offers or arrangements. Through the <a
								href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ecologisation-greening/achats-procurement/politique-policy-eng.html"
								rel="external">Policy on Green Procurement</a>, Canada has strengthened environmental
							performance considerations into the procurement process. In this context, value for money
							includes the consideration of many factors such as cost, performance, availability, quality
							and environmental performance.</li>
						<li>The <abbr title="Product, Resource, Operating, and Contingent">PROC</abbr> technique should
							be used for Major Crown Projects and in procurement in which operating costs are a major
							part of the total cost of the product, for example, major construction projects or motor
							vehicle purchases. (See <a href="#section-9">Chapter 9 - Special Procurements</a>.)</li>

					<li>Pricing is a fundamental enabler to the achievement of best possible value in a procurement.
						Effective pricing begins with the development of a pricing strategy that closely aligns with the
						overall procurement strategy to ensure pricing decisions are in accordance with the
						procurement’s objectives and priorities.</li>
					<li>In order to effectively manage a pricing strategy throughout the acquisition lifecycle and to
						ensure it successfully meets the procurement’s objectives, contracting officers should consider
						the following key pricing considerations (Section 2.1 of the <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner&#39;s Guide
							for Procurement Pricing</a>):<br>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>managing pricing throughout the acquisition lifecycle: monitor, review and evaluate;
							</li>
							<li>engaging expert advice, as needed;</li>
							<li>documenting and justifying all key pricing decisions and incorporate them in the
								contract;</li>
							<li>developing a validation strategy; and</li>
							<li>capturing and tracking lessons learned.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>As contracts are awarded competitively and non-competitively, contract pricing can be determined
						by Market Based Pricing, Commercial Pricing or Pricing Principles.<br>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>For Market Based Pricing, the price is assessed and established when there exists
								sufficient competition to obtain more than one competitive bid and price comparison.
								Canada makes every effort to ensure that the price of goods and services is determined
								by the market through competition.</li>
							<li>Commercial Pricing is used by the contractor for the price of goods and services sold to
								the general public or entities for non-government purposes, in other words, the price in
								ordinary trade between buyers and sellers free of bargain. See <a
									href="#section-3.145.1">3.145.1 Commercial pricing</a> for more information.</li>
							<li>Negotiated Pricing occurs when a contract requires any type of price negotiation, such
								as in the following situations: 1) pricing for a non- competitive contract; 2) price
								negotiations in a competitive contract subsequent to the award for specific pricing
								aspects not included in the initial financial bids (i.e. contract amendments,
								extensions); and 3) use of incentives involving costs. The Pricing Principles found in
								Section 5.0 of the <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
									Guide for Procurement Pricing</a> should be applied to all scenarios requiring price
								negotiations.<p>There are two main categories of Pricing Principles:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Cost-Based Pricing Principles</strong> is the approach most commonly
										used in the absence of competition in Canada and internationally in the
										negotiation of a price. The contract price consists of the following three
										components: 1) cost-base, based on actual or estimated costs; 2) profit, that is
										determined and layered on the cost-base; and 3) incentives, as applicable. See
										Section 5.0.1 of the <a
											href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner&#39;s
											Guide for Procurement Pricing</a> and <a href="#section-10">Chapter 10 Cost
											and Profit</a> of the Supply Manual for more information on cost and profit;
										and</li>
									<li><strong>Alternative Pricing Principles provides</strong> details on the process
										to follow for the implementation of alternatives to Cost-Based Pricing. This is
										used when justification exists that an alternative pricing method might generate
										better value than the application of the Cost-Based Pricing Principles. See
										Section 5.3 of the <a
											href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
											Guide for Procurement Pricing</a> and <a href="#section-10.75">Chapter 10.75
											Alternative pricing strategies</a> of the Supply Manual for more
										information.</li>

					<ol type="a">
						<li>Commercial pricing is the price of goods and services customarily used by and sold to the
							general public or entities for non-government purposes, in other words the price in ordinary
							trade between buyers and sellers free of bargain. The commercial price includes both the
							contractor’s costs and profit.</li>
						<li>Commercial pricing is applied when there is a sufficient number of buyers existing to
							establish a relevant market price for the good and service. For example, published catalogue
							prices for powerful binoculars sold to many different customers such as individuals and
							companies for camping, hunting, recreational, and industrial purposes.</li>
						<li>Commercial pricing can also apply to a procurement as a whole or to specific components of a
							procurement where commercial pricing is available. For example, there are two major
							components for a contract. The first component is for a radio communication device that is
							used and sold to many other customers such as individuals and companies for outdoor,
							recreational and industrial purposes. Whereas the second component is for the repair and
							maintenance of these devices which is not a normally offered service to this supplier’s
							customers. The first component of this contract can be commercially priced, whereas the
							second component does not have a commercial price.</li>
						<li>When establishing a commercial price, sufficient price support must be obtained to validate
							the price provided by a contractor.</li>
						<li>See Section 5.0.2 Commercial Pricing of the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide

						<li>Contracting officers are also responsible for identifying the need for a new standard,

						<li>Clients are responsible for stating their requirement for Government Quality Assurance

						<li>Contracting officers must be aware of the use and application of &quot;acquisition
							cards&quot;. The intent of acquisition cards is to provide a convenient and less burdensome
							method of procuring and paying for goods and services, while ensuring effective financial
							control. It is government policy to use acquisition cards for departmental procurement and
							payment of goods and services (within the levels of procurement authority delegated to
							departments) where it is efficient, economical and operationally feasible to do so. This
							policy applies to all organizations considered to be departments within the meaning of
							section 2 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/"

					</header>
					<ol class="double-space" type="a">
						<li>The acquisition card has been in the forefront of most procurement and payment process
							improvements in client departments. The increasing use of acquisition cards has had an
							impact on the traditional paper based control framework. The Office of the Auditor General
							conducted a government-wide review of acquisition card usage, and the report stressed the
							need for better controls and better monitoring by departments.</li>
						<li>&quot;Corporate Acquisition Cards&quot; are designed to help eliminate paper in the
							procurement process. These cards allow an employee to charge purchases for which full
							payment is made by the department to the applicable card provider. There is no fee for the
							cards and conditional discounts can be obtained in exchange for faster and/or electronic
							settlement.</li>
						<li>Like a personal credit card:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
								<li>the cardholder receives a monthly statement listing purchases;</li>
								<li>each cardholder is assigned a credit limit; and</li>
								<li>suppliers receive 97 to 98.5 percent of the purchase price within two days of
									purchase.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Unlike a personal credit card:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
								<li>the department is obligated to pay either individual invoices for each card or one
									&quot;consolidated&quot; bill summarizing monthly purchases made by all cardholders;
								</li>
								<li>there is a defined maximum liability of $50 to the department in the event of
									fraudulent use;</li>
								<li>there is special application of financial authorities; and</li>
								<li>a department can obtain access to all card transactions.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The card is issued in the name of the employee designated to do the purchasing; however, the
							liability rests with the sponsoring department. Most important, the dollar amount of
							purchases and monthly limits associated with acquisition cards are controlled by the
							card-using organization.</li>
						<li>The use of acquisition cards within federal government departments and agencies offers very
							significant opportunities for savings in the procurement through payment process. Client
							departments can reduce and simplify the procurement process of goods and services using
							acquisition cards. Local purchase orders and petty cash are eliminated and a single payment
							is made for multiple purchases. The ease and flexibility of using the cards provide an
							incentive to purchase only as the need arises rather than buying in bulk. By using an
							acquisition card to make the purchase and then settling these purchases electronically,
							departments can realize significant savings. Taken across government, this approach allows
							for major cost avoidance in the procurement process.</li>

					<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2010-01-11</time>)</p>
				</header>
				<ol class="double-space" type="a">
					<li>If royalty payments, technical assistance agreements or manufacturing licenses are required or
						anticipated as being required, the contracting officer must plan for these events within the
						procurement strategy submitted for approval. Establishing these types of agreements can have
						very long timeframe and can be a very complex process.</li>
					<li>In order to carry out certain contracts, primarily for defence, contractors may have to obtain
						technical assistance and/or manufacturing licenses from third parties.</li>
					<li>The usual commercial practice is for the contractor to enter into a technical assistance and/or
						license agreement. However, there are cases where it may be more advantageous for Canada to
						enter, in its own name, into the license agreement with respect to inventions, patents,
						copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, technical data, know-how and industrial designs.</li>
					<li>In order to avoid paying for rights that the government already has, contracting officers should
						check that no license agreement in Canada&#39;s name exists, which could remove the need for
						royalty payments.</li>
					<li>Contracting officers should minimize the use of patented products, by calling up performance
						specifications rather than product specifications. When there is no alternative, market-based
						processes for the supply of patented products through licensed production arrangements,
						royalties, etc., must be exhausted before using section 19 of the <cite><a
								href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-4/index.html" rel="external">Patent
								Act</a></cite> or section 22 of the <cite><a
								href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-1/" rel="external">Defence Production
								Act</a></cite>.</li>
					<li>Royalty payments of 5 percent or less of the selling price of the patented item require the
						Director approval. A royalty that exceeds 5 percent requires the Deputy Minister approval,
						before entry into a contract.</li>
					<li>If there is an increase in the amount of the royalty to be paid, or if further items become
						subject to royalty payments during the life of a contract, the same guidelines for approval
						apply.</li>
					<li>To obtain the approval of the Deputy Minister for royalties exceeding 5 percent, the following
						information must be provided on Part 2 of the Contract Request:<ol class="double-space"
							type="i">
							<li>details of the royalties;</li>
							<li>a forecast of anticipated future purchases beyond the requirement in the present
								submission;</li>
							<li>the comments of Legal Services.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>In consultation with Legal Services, the contracting officer must consider the advantages and
						disadvantages before deciding that a license should be obtained in the name of Canada or the
						contractor. These advantages and disadvantages are to be considered in relation to the nature of
						the supplies to be manufactured, the expenditure by Canada, potential purchases by Canada and
						the relationship between the potential contractor and the licensor; for example, the contractor
						may be a subsidiary of the licensor.</li>
					<li>Advantages- if the license agreement is in the name of Canada, Canada can:<ol
							class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>negotiate terms and ensure that no restrictions are placed on the use, sale, lease or
								exchange of supplies. Such restrictions, if imposed, might interfere with Canada&#39;s
								obligations under international defence arrangements;</li>
							<li>gave unrestricted choice of contractors; and</li>
							<li>control the manner in which required technical assistance must be furnished and used.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Disadvantages- if the license agreement is in the name of Canada, Canada may:<ol
							class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>become involved in contractual negotiations apart from the contract it is presently
								interested in;</li>
							<li>have to assume onerous burdens dealing with secrecy, non-disclosure and informing the
								licensor of improvements and developments;</li>
							<li>be bound by all terms of the agreement and be required to pay royalties at a set rate
								and assume other burdens for a long period.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Royalties required to be paid by contractors and their subcontractors to third parties, in the
						performance of a defence contract, will be paid if they are valid costs in the bid, and the
						amounts being charged are acceptable to Canada.</li>
					<li>Where the license agreement must be in the name of the contractor, approval to enter into such
						an agreement may be obtained as part of the authority for the purchase of the goods and/or
						services.</li>
					<li>Where the license must be in the name of Canada, the contracting officer, when negotiating the
						license agreement and the amount of the royalty payment, should take into consideration the
						following:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>manufacturing rights, including use of licensor&#39;s patents and designs;</li>
							<li>technical assistance, including:<ol class="double-space" type="A">
									<li>supply of plans, drawings, specifications, etc.;</li>
									<li>engineering person-days provided by the licensor both at its own plant and the
										plant of the manufacturer selected by Canada;</li>
									<li>travel and living expenses of the licensor&#39;s representatives;</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>obtaining for Canada the right to modify or have modified the plans, drawings, etc.,
								and, if required, the right to build or have built or to repair or have repaired the
								articles in question by a party other than the licensor.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Approval of the Assistant Deputy Minister is required before entry into any contractual
						agreement that exercises the rights of Canada under section 22 of the <cite><a
								href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-1/" rel="external">Defence Production
								Act</a></cite> or section 19 of the <cite><a
								href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-4/index.html" rel="external">Patent
								Act</a></cite>. Exercising the rights granted to Canada under these acts must only be
						carried out in exceptional circumstances as warranted by consideration of the public interest,
						and after market-based processes have been exhausted. Note:Examples of these circumstances would
						include refusal by a patent holder to produce or license others to produce a product vital to
						the defence of Canada, or where monopoly power conferred by the patent is being abused to impose
						unconsciously high prices upon Canada. It would be very unusual to find these rights exercised
						for other than defence supplies.</li>

							<li>Risk assessment is the process whereby risks and their potential outcomes are identified
								and measured according to their probability of occurrence and degree of severity. The
								outcome of the risk assessment is a report on the quantified value of the risks and it
								is used to guide decision-making in the contracting process. The risk assessment is an
								important tool because it forms the basis of risk-based decision-making.</li>
							<li>Risk assessments are conducted by client organizations, as the requisitioning
								authorities, and they can vary in depth and complexity. Risk assessments can be
								performed by contracted firms under a standing offer or directly by a client
								organization. The decision as to who conducts the risk assessment will take into account
								technical capacity, resources and funding.</li>
							<li>Each risk assessment will examine and measure the sources of potential loss (exposures)
								over which a contractor has control. The risk assessment can also identify and segregate
								the exposures over which the client department has control. Examples of general
								exposures include property, assets, legal liability, personnel and reputation.</li>
							<li>The risk assessment will draw on the various risks that the client organization
								identifies. Information on risks can come from a variety of sources, such as records and
								data; questionnaires; surveys and exploratory testing; and process maps.</li>

						</header>
						<p>Risk control comprises risk treatment that requires taking action to avoid, prevent, reduce
							or transfer losses. Risk control can occur before, or after, a loss event. The various
							methods of loss control usually require on organization to develop, implement and maintain
							various processes and procedures to ensure the effectiveness and success of the risk control
							program.</p>
						<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>Loss avoidanceis the technique by which an organization will refrain from various
								activities because of the severe nature of the risk. For example, a contractor can exit
								a certain line of business because losses incurred by that business threaten the
								viability of the firm. For example, a food services firm may sell off its tobacco
								business line due to the potential for costly class action lawsuits.</li>
							<li>Loss preventionis the technique used to prevent losses from occurring, or to reduce
								their likelihood of occurrence. Loss prevention measures are often found in engineered
								or automated processes, such as intrusion detection and access control. In their simpler
								form, loss prevention measures can include elements such as wide-angle mirrors on
								vehicles to prevent collisions while reversing.</li>
							<li>Loss reductionis the technique used to reduce the impact of a loss once it has occurred.
								Loss reduction measures can include engineered systems, such as automatic fire
								suppression systems (e.g. sprinklers). They can be found in business applications
								process, such as business continuity plans or crisis management programs.</li>
							<li>Contractual transfer for risk controlis a risk control measure that uses contract
								conditions to transfer the risk of loss and/or the obligation to control loss to a
								contractor. The most notable form is the contractual requirement for indemnification,
								which requires the contractor to make good losses it causes. In addition to
								indemnification, a contract may contain other conditions, such as liability for loss,
								which can be specifically targeted to certain types of loss and the amount of financial
								obligation. In addition, the contractor may be required to manage and monitor losses it
								incurs in the delivery of the contract and report to the clients.</li>

						<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>Risk financing is the technique through which organizations provide funding for
								potential losses. Although the most commonly known form of risk financing is insurance,
								there are other methods that are frequently used. Canada uses the
								&quot;self-underwriting&quot; option in the management risks to which it is exposed and
								over which it has control.</li>
							<li>Canada uses the self-underwriting option as a default approach for its own risk
								financing because it has the legislative authority and capacity as a sovereign entity to
								raise funds directly to pay for losses.</li>
							<li>Contractors are responsible for financing the risks under their control. Contractors
								will most often use commercial insurance to finance their risks, although other risk
								financing options are available. Contractors use the commercial insurance market to
								obtain insurance and within the marketplace, insurance policies are underwritten and
								financed by insurers, with insurance brokers fulfilling the roles of marketing and
								distribution.</li>
							<li>Contractors can manage risk financing on a variety of models:<ol class="double-space"
									type="i">
									<li>Insurance transfer, where the contractor purchases commercial insurance with
										standard deductibles, transferring most of the financial risk to the insurer in
										exchange for premium.</li>
									<li>Self Insured retention, where the contractor assumes financial responsibility to
										a certain level and transfers risk above that level to insurers. This differs
										from a deductible because the contractor will manage the retained risk through
										risk control and self-funding measures.</li>
									<li>Alternative risk financing,which involves other forms of risk financing sources,
										such as capital and bond markets and &quot;captive&quot; insurance.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Canada can exercise the following risk financing options in contracting to ensure an
								appropriate level of financial protection from contractors:<ol class="double-space"
									type="i">
									<li>contractor controlled insurance, wherein Canada self-underwrites its own risks
										and relies upon the judgement of the contractor to determine its own insurance
										requirements;</li>
									<li>g overnment specified insurance, where Canada self-underwrites its own risks and
										specifies the types and minimum coverage limits of insurance that the contractor
										must maintain;</li>
									<li>g overnment controlled insurance, where Canada purchases and controls the
										insurance as a way of obtaining economies of scale in project involving multiple
										parties.</li>

					</header>
					<section>
						<h4>1.0 Purpose</h4>
						<p>The purpose of the Guide to Preparing and Administering Task Authorizations is to provide
							procedural guidance to Public Works and Government Services Canada&#39;s ( <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>&#39;s) clients when
							contracts for services containing task authorizations are issued by <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and the client is
							authorized to issue individual task authorizations (TAs). This guide incorporates advice on
							preparing and administering <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. Many of the
							principles discussed in this document equally apply to other mechanisms by which goods or
							services are ordered under a contract on an &quot;as and when requested&quot; basis such as
							a service order. For the Department of National Defence (DND) requirements, this guide
							supplements the internal procedure for administering <abbr
								title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s documented in article 3.3.2 of <abbr
								title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr>&#39;s Procurement Administration
							Manual (PAM).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>2.0 Definitions</h4>
						<section>
							<h4>2.1 Contracts with Task Authorizations</h4>
							<p>A contract with Task Authorizations (TAs) is a method of supply for services under which
								all of the work or a portion of the work will be performed on an &quot;as and when
								requested basis&quot; through predetermined conditions including an administrative
								process involving task authorizations.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>2.2 Task Authorization</h4>
							<p>A <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is a structured administrative tool enabling
								<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> or a client, or
								both to authorize work, by a contractor on an &quot;as and when requested&quot; basis in
								accordance with the conditions of the contract.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>3.0 Application of Contracts with Task Authorizations</h4>
						<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>A contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s may be used when there is a
								definite need for services but the exact nature, the timeframes of the required
								services, activities and deliverables will only be known when the service(s) will be
								required during the period of the contract. <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> determines when the
								client&#39;s needs would be best addressed by the use of a contract with <abbr
									title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. If the client is authorized to issue <abbr
									title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the limit of this approval would be
								stipulated in the contract. All <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s in excess of
								this limit have to be forwarded to <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> for authorization.
								A contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s can be set up to cover
								multiple years. This approach can eliminate the need to establish a new contract every
								year. Multiple contracts with task authorizations may be issued in certain circumstances
								when one contract would not be sufficient to fulfill all requirements. In such cases,
								the contractors&#39; order of ranking, the specific work allocation process,
								Canada&#39;s total liability for all issue <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s
								and the authorization limit would be identified in the contracts.</li>
							<li>Some examples of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are as
								follows:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>a requirement for translation where the work is generally defined and the
										specific tasks for translation (e.g. a required translation of 50,000 words) are
										on an as and when requested basis;</li>
									<li>a requirement for maintenance of equipment where the general maintenance work is
										defined in the contract and, when the equipment failure/issue occurs, the
										specific maintenance task is authorized on an as and when requested basis;</li>
									<li>a requirement for an informatics technology specialist over a defined period,
										but the specific activities and deliverables cannot be identified in advance nor
										the timing or level of effort predicted.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>An advantage of using contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s is the
								mitigation of contractual risks as a result of better-defined tasks, the establishment
								of a level of effort on a per task basis and more precise pricing for each specific task
								thereby ensuring better management of the contract.</li>
							<li>When they are properly used, contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s
								provide a structured framework offering operational speed and flexibility to clients.
								Contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s will be successful provided
								that there is a clear understanding and agreement between <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and the client as
								to their respective roles and responsibilities relating to the management of the
								contract including for authorizing and issuing <abbr
									title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and task authorization management. The
								improper use of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s can lead to
								major problems between the government and its suppliers, between <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and its clients,
								and for the government in the eyes of the public.</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>4.0 Conditions of Use</h4>
						<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>As a condition of use of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the
								<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting
								officer will, as a minimum:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>ensure the contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s is the
										appropriate method of supply for these required services in consultation with
										the client.</li>
									<li>decide whether the client will be allowed to authorize and issue <abbr
											title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, and determine the financial limit of
										this authority. These decisions will be made in consultation with the client and
										the associated provisions will be detailed in the contract. All <abbr
											title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s in excess of the determined limit must
										be forwarded to <abbr
											title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> for
										authorization and issuance.</li>
									<li>consult with the client to reach an agreement on the roles and responsibilities
										of both organizations including the client&#39;s responsibilities for reporting.
									</li>
									<li>discuss, as required, the use of contracts with <abbr
											title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s with the client and in particular the
										administration of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>5.0 Task Authorization Process and Administration</h4>
						<p>The client authorized to issue tasks to the contractor is responsible for issuing <abbr
								title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s in accordance with the <abbr
								title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> process and administration of the <abbr
								title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> detailed in the contract. If the task does not seem

								rel="external">Directive on Delegation of Financial Authorities for Disbursements</a>

									Administration Act</a></cite>. In Chapter 3 of the <a

								rel="external">2008 December Report of the Auditor General of Canada</a>, the Office of

							functions under the responsibility of one individual was not in keeping with the <abbr
								title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Policy on Delegation of Authorities. Therefore, <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> recommends that the
							client ensure that the individual who signs the task authorization not also certify
							associated invoices. However, as specified in the above-mentioned <abbr
								title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> directive, where the client&#39;s current processes in

								<li>Do not request that <abbr

							</ol>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>9.2 Employer-Employee Relationships</h4>
							<ol class="double-space" type="a">
								<li>Avoid using employment-type language in describing the work such as specifying the
									number of hours of work per day/week or the manner in which the work is to be
									conducted.</li>
								<li>Avoid long-term assignments or a continuing relationship where a steady income
									stream from the department or agency is involved; state clearly the start and
									completion dates and ensure the contractor sets his or her hours of work.</li>
								<li>Avoid controlling how the contractor carries out the work; work and results should
									only be overseen by the project/technical authority.</li>
								<li>Avoid having the contractor work on government premises.</li>
							</ol>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h4>9.3 Administration of Task Authorizations</h4>
							<ol class="double-space" type="a">
								<li>Do not split a requirement to get around the client authority limit stipulated in
									the contract.</li>
								<li>Avoid task descriptions for <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s that could
									create a conflict of interest.</li>
								<li>Ensure the price is fair and reasonable for the specific task and in accordance with

						<li>Purpose<br>The purpose of this document is to formalize a Record of Agreement between <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and the Authorized
							Client regarding their respective roles and responsibilities when using the contract with
							task authorizations identified above (refer to the &quot;Matrix of Roles and
							Responsibilities&quot; attached hereto). It is imperative that the Authorized Client and the
							<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority
							work closely together at all times during the period of the contract.</li>
						<li>Period of the Agreement<br>The conditions of this Record of Agreement will be in effect for
							the entire duration of the contract.</li>
						<li>Task Authorization<br>As specified in the contract (once awarded), the Authorized
							Client&#39;s designated authority may authorize individual task authorizations up to a limit
							of $<span class="input-required"><var title="blank">______</var><kbd>(<em>insert
										amount</em>)</kbd></span>, Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax
							(HST) extra, inclusive of any revisions to the authorized <abbr
								title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. Any <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> in
							excess of that limit or any revisions to the authorized <abbr
								title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> that would increase the <abbr
								title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> total value above that limit must be authorized by

										Authority&quot; or&quot;the <abbr
											title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Contracting
										Authority&quot;</em>)</kbd></span> before issuance.</li>
						<li>Contract Amendment Process<br>The Authorized Client understands that it must not request the
							contractor to perform any work in excess of or outside the scope of the contract and it must
							not issue <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s where the cumulative value of all
							<abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s would exceed the contract value. Any anticipated
							changes to the contract must be authorized, in writing, by the <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority
							through the issuance of a contract amendment before any additional work or <abbr
								title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is authorized. At any time during the contract
							period, when there is a need to amend the contract, the Authorized Client mustinform the
							<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority
							accordingly, in writing (email), and provide him/her the following:<ol type="a">
								<li>a clear and accurate rationale for amending the contract; e.g. the reason why the
									work cannot be completed by the contract expiry date, why there is a shortfall of
									funds, etc.;</li>
								<li>the cumulative value of all <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s (<abbr
										title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> or <abbr
										title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> extra) issued to date;</li>
								<li>the total contract expenditures (<abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> or
									<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> extra) to date;</li>
								<li>the estimated price breakdown for any additional work required;</li>
								<li>the consequences of not amending;</li>
								<li>justification for the required amendment versus initiating a new procurement; and
								</li>
								<li>the status of the replacement procurement in the case of on-going work.</li>
							</ol>If <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> determines
							that the contract cannot be amended, the Authorized Client will be advised accordingly. If
							the contract can be amended, the Authorized Client will then forward to the <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority a
							duly signed requisition amendment ( <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>- <abbr
								title="Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada">TPSGC</abbr> 9200).</li>
						<li>Contract Management – Corrective Measures<br>If there are indications that the Authorized
							Client is not complying with the conditions of this agreement, the <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority
							will discuss the matter with the Authorized Client&#39;s designated representative, the
							contractor or both and take any of the following corrective measures, deemed appropriate:<ol
								type="a">
								<li>change the detail and/or frequency of the information reporting;</li>
								<li>discuss with the Authorized Client&#39;s staff responsible for issuing <abbr
										title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, or with the contractor if needed;</li>
								<li>reduce any dollar limit that might have been placed on individual <abbr
										title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and/or suspend or cancel the Authorized
									Client&#39;s authority limit for <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>
									authorization.</li>
							</ol>Both parties agree to comply with the conditions of this Record of Agreement. Further,
							it is understood and agreed that this agreement may be amended from time to time, as
							necessary. Except for any change resulting from a corrective measure specified in 5 (a) to
							(c) above, amendments will not be implemented until an amended Record of Agreement has been
							formalized and accepted via email by both parties.</li>

				</header>
				<p>* For general information on the Canadian Content Policy, please see <a href="#section-3.130">3.130
						Canadian Content Policy</a>.</p>
				<ol class="double-space" type="a">
					<li>The Canadian Rules of Origin for Goods (<a
							href="https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/assets/pdfs/agreements-accords/cusma-aceum/r-cusma-04.pdf"
							rel="external">Chapter 4</a> of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement) and Canadian
						Customs Tariff Harmonized System (HS) are used to determine if imported components that go into
						the production of an item for resale to the government are sufficiently altered or converted in
						Canada to be considered &quot;Canadian&quot;.</li>
					<li>The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System is a structured classification system for
						goods that has been adopted by Canada and most of the world&#39;s trading nations, for customs
						purposes. The most recent <a
							href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/trade-commerce/tariff-tarif/menu-eng.html"
							rel="external">Canadian Customs Tariff</a> can be found on the Canada Border Services Agency
						website.</li>
					<li>For the purposes of this determination, the reference to &quot;territory of one or more of the
						parties&quot; in the Rules of Origin must be replaced with &quot;Canada&quot;.</li>
					<li>Products containing imported components may be considered Canadian when they have undergone
						sufficient change in Canada in a manner that satisfies this amended definition. There are three
						basic steps to determine if any product that is partially or wholly constructed from imported
						components meets the Rules of Origin definition:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>Locate the heading number in the Harmonized System that best reflects the final product
								for sale.</li>
							<li>Find the appropriate heading number in the Harmonized System that identifies imported
								components used to construct the final product.</li>
							<li>Look up the section in the rules of origin that defines whether the conversion that took
								place in Canada allows the goods to be defined as Canadian.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Example 1: Determining whether a good is Canadian</h3>
				<ol class="double-space" type="a">
					<li>A bidder proposes hats, which are manufactured in Canada that use imported calves leather.</li>
					<li>Analysis of Canadian content:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>Look up &quot;hats&quot; in the index of the <abbr title="Harmonized System">HS</abbr>
								and find the type that matches the kinds of hats to be sold: Hats and other headgear,
								plaited or made by assembling strips of any material, whether or not lined or trimmed.
								The <abbr title="Harmonized System">HS</abbr> number is 6504.00. The first two numbers
								indicate the good is listed in Chapter 65.</li>
							<li>Look up &quot;leather, bovine&quot; in the index: it is located in Chapter 41.</li>
							<li>Finally, refer to the Rules of Origin which lists the conditions for transforming goods
								listed in the <abbr title="Harmonized System">HS</abbr> into Canadian goods (Chapter 65
								is for Headgear and Parts Thereof). The second rule for Chapter 65 applies: A change to
								65.04 through 65.07 from any heading outside that group. As the leather is classified
								outside 65.04 through 65.07, the final product (the hats) for sale are considered to be
								sufficiently transformed and therefore the hats are deemed to be Canadian for the
								purposes of this policy.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Example 2: Determining whether a mix of goods and services meets the 80 percent Rule of Origin</h3>
				<ol class="double-space" type="a">
					<li>There is a <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> solicitation
						for:<ul>
							<li>100 wooden office desks;</li>

					<li>A bidder has proposed:<ul>
							<li>unfinished wooden office desks which are imported into Canada and finished in Canada;

								parts. The maintenance/repair of the telephones is being done by United States-based
								individuals;</li>
							<li>metal swivel chairs which were constructed using domestic labour/materials and some
								imported parts.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Below are the prices for the goods and services offered in the bid:<ul>
							<li>100 wooden office desks @ $150 each = $15,000</li>
							<li>100 electric space heaters @ $200 each = $20,000</li>
							<li>Maintenance/Repair = $5,000</li>
							<li>100 telephone sets @ $50 each = $5,000</li>

							<li>Wooden office desks:<ol class="double-space" type="A">
									<li>Unfinished wooden office desks (<abbr title="Harmonized System">HS</abbr>

										9403.90 provided there is a regional value content of not less than 60 percent
										where the transaction value method is used or 50 percent where the net cost
										method is used.</li>
									<li>As a general rule of interpretation of the <abbr
											title="Harmonized System">HS</abbr>, finished and unfinished articles fall
										into the same heading or subheading where the unfinished article has the
										essential characteristics of the finished. As such, the final good (finished
										wooden office desks) falls in same the subheading (<abbr
											title="Harmonized System">HS</abbr> 9403.30) as the unfinished good. There
										was also no change from subheading 9403.90. Thus, this rule is not met.</li>
									<li>Therefore, the wooden office desks are not considered Canadian goods.</li>

								supply for services under which all of the work or a portion of the work will be
								performed on an &quot;as and when requested&quot; basis through predetermined conditions
								including an administrative process involving task authorizations. Contracts with <abbr
									title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are used in service contracting situations
								when there is a defined need by a client to rapidly have access to one or more category
								of service(s) that are expected to be needed on a repetitive basis during the period of
								the contract. Under contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the work
								to be carried out can be defined but the exact nature and timeframes of the required
								services, activities and deliverables will only be known as and when the service(s) will
								be required during the period of the contract. The contract with <abbr
									title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s must stipulate the conditions for issuing
								<abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. A <abbr
									title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is a structured administrative tool enabling
								<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> or a client to
								authorize work by a contractor on an &quot;as and when requested&quot; basis in

								unable to offer a minimum work guarantee, or wants to maintain multiple sources of
								supply. It is used to satisfy the requirements of departments and agencies for commonly
								ordered, commercially available goods, services or both, by arranging with suppliers to
								submit standing offers to provide goods, services or both, during a specified period. A
								call-up against a standing offer is a contract.</td>
							<td headers="t14_43 t14_47 t14_46">This method of supply is used to establish a pool of

						<li>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a form of bid solicitation that is used when the bidder
							selection is based on best value rather than on price alone. A <abbr
								title="Request for Proposal">RFP</abbr> should be used when, owing to the nature of the
							requirement, suppliers are invited to propose a solution to a problem, requirement or
							objective, and the selection of the contractor is based on the effectiveness of the proposed
							solution.</li>
						<li>Bids must be evaluated and the successful supplier must be selected in accordance with
							specific criteria and procedures as set out in the bid solicitation.</li>
						<li>A bid solicitation can be used to solicit bids through public advertisement on <abbr
								title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>, through direct invitation
							of selected suppliers by means of a source list where permitted, or by invitation of one
							source only if conditions for a non-competitive process have been met.</li>
						<li>Responses to the bid solicitation may result in negotiations before contract award when the
							bid solicitation states the right to negotiate in accordance with the international trade
							agreements and/or the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).</li>
						<li>The preparation of bids is often costly to suppliers. To keep the total cost down while
							ensuring freedom of access to suppliers, consideration should be given to soliciting bids in
							two steps.<ol class="double-space" type="i">
								<li>during the first step of this process, suppliers are requested to provide letters of
									interest and qualifications, from which a short list is developed. During the second
									step, suppliers on the short list are requested to submit detailed bids;</li>
								<li>suppliers not included on the short list are still able to request the bid
									solicitation and submit bids.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Such a process might be appropriate where many suppliers are known. When doing a two-stage
							procurement, contracting officers must follow procedures required under the applicable
							international trade agreements and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) related to
							selective tendering and prequalification of suppliers, respectively.</li>
						<li>The bid solicitation should include, as a minimum, the following information:<ol

						</header>
						<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>One Standing Offer:<br>Where only one standing offer will be authorized for use as the
								result of a competitive <abbr title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSO</abbr>, the
								resulting call-ups are considered competitive and the competitive call-up authorities
								can be used.</li>
							<li>Multiple Standing Offers:<br>If more than one standing offer will be authorized for use
								based on a reasonable expectation of business activity such that a single offeror would
								lack the capacity to meet the demands, clear ranking methodologies and call-up
								procedures must be described in the <abbr
									title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSO</abbr>, so that suppliers are aware of
								these when preparing their offer. The two models of ranking methodology are described
								below:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>right of first refusal basis:<br>The call-up procedures require that when a
										requirement is identified, the identified user will contact the highest-ranked
										offeror to determine if the requirement can be satisfied by that offeror. If the
										highest-ranked offeror is able to meet the requirement, a call-up is made
										against its standing offer. If that offeror is unable to meet the requirement,
										the identified user will contact the next ranked offeror. The identified user
										will continue and proceed as above until one offeror indicates that it can meet
										the requirement of the call-up. In other words, call-ups are made based on the
										&quot;right of first refusal&quot; basis. When the highest-ranked offeror is
										unable to fulfill the need, the identified user is required to document its file
										appropriately. The resulting call-ups are considered competitive and the
										competitive call-up authorities can be used.</li>
									<li>proportional basis:<br>The call-up procedures require that call-ups be issued on
										a proportional basis such that the highest-ranked offeror receives the largest
										predetermined portion of the work; the second highest-ranked offeror receives
										the second largest predetermined portion of the work, etc. (for example, 50
										percent to the highest-ranked offer, 30 percent to the next highest-ranked offer
										and 20 percent to the third highest-ranked offer). This predetermined
										distribution of the resulting work is to be described in the <abbr
											title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSO</abbr> so that potential offerors
										are aware of these when preparing their offer. It is also known as
										&quot;collective best value&quot;. The highest-ranked standing offer represents
										the best value for Canada, and its offeror receives the largest portion of the
										work. A clear advantage in terms of distribution of expected business volume
										should be given to the highest-ranked offeror (for example, 20 percent or more
										than the next offer) and the same for the others. The determination of what
										constitutes a clear advantage is the responsibility of the contracting officer
										and may vary by commodity, service or by business case. The resultant call-ups
										are considered competitive and the competitive call-up authorities can be
										used.<br>Where individual standing offers are to be authorized based on the
										proportional basis approach, the contracting officer should inform the
										authorized user of his/her obligation to monitor call-up activities to ensure
										work is allocated in accordance with predetermined work distribution.</li>
									<li>In both cases above, contracting officers should clearly state in the <abbr
											title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSO</abbr> the expected number of
										standing offers that are intended to be authorized for use. If the intention is
										that multiple standing offers will be authorized for use, the <abbr
											title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSO</abbr> should state the basis upon
										which call-ups will be issued, whether right of first refusal, proportional or
										another method. If call-ups must be issued against standing offers under the
										proportional basis approach, the breakdown must be stated (for example, 50
										percent, 30 percent and 20 percent) in the <abbr
											title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSO</abbr>.</li>
									<li>In addition to the above, when the intention is that multiple standing offers
										will be authorized for use, contracting officers could include a condition that
										only those standing offers, which are within, for example, 10 percent of the
										best-priced offer, will be considered. The method of such calculations should be
										explicitly described in the <abbr
											title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSO</abbr>.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Non-competitive call-ups:<br>In other instances, more than one <abbr
									title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> will be authorized for use but no ranking is
								established. This would occur, for example, when prices are sought for a full range of
								items contained in a catalogue where items and ranking of offers is impossible. The
								authorized call-up authority may choose whichever <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr>
								to use. For some requirements, the contracting officers may set parameters to guide the
								authorized users in the selection of one of the standing offers. Call-ups made against
								these standing offers are non-competitive and only the non-competitive call-up
								authorities can be used.</li>

							ineligible or suspended under the <a
								href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/politique-policy-eng.html"
								rel="external"><em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em></a>. A first tier contractor
							is defined in the Policy as “a subcontractor with whom a supplier has a direct contractual
							relationship to perform a portion of the work pursuant to a contract or real property
							agreement between the supplier and Canada, unless the subcontractor merely supplies
							commercial-off-the-shelf goods to the supplier”.</li>
						<li>Bidders are responsible for verifying the status of first tier subcontractors prior to
							submitting a bid that identifies first tier subcontractors and before entering into a
							contractual relationship with first tier subcontractors.</li>
						<li>If a contractor must enter into a first tier subcontract with an ineligible or suspended
							subcontractor, they must first obtain written approval of the appropriate deputy head or
							delegate by forwarding this request to the contracting authority. Contractors who enter into
							a first tier subcontract with an ineligible or suspended first tier subcontractor without
							the prior written consent from the relevant deputy head can be declared ineligible for a
							period of five years from the date of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC)’s
							determination.</li>
						<li>If a successful bidder wishes to replace a first tier subcontractor that has been determined
							ineligible or suspended prior to contract award, a rigorous re-evaluation process that
							ensures that all bidders are treated fairly and equally must be followed. This process will
							be tailored, as appropriate, to individual situations and the specific procurement
							circumstances at hand.</li>
						<li>Any request from successful bidders wishing to replace a now ineligible or suspended first
							tier subcontractor, or from contractors wishing to enter into a first tier subcontract with
							an ineligible or suspended subcontractor must be sent to the Acquisition Program Integrity

							href="mailto:dmc-cgd@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca" rel="external">dmc-cgd@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a> for
						further verification. Once the contracting officer has verified that the person requesting the
						controlled goods is registered, the solicitation documents, drawings, statements of work, etc.

					<li>An export permit to ship a controlled Technical Data Package (TDP) is required to all countries
						except, in most cases, the United States. Contracting officers must first determine if their
						<abbr title="Technical Data Package">TDP</abbr> is, in fact, controlled. The ultimate authority
						for making this determination is the Export Controls Division, Department of Foreign Affairs and
						International Trade Canada (DFAIT). A determination needs to be made as to whether or not the
						supplier has access to controlled goods, in Canada, under the <cite><a
								href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-1/" rel="external">Defence Production
								Act</a></cite>.</li>
					<li>Generally, if the <abbr title="Technical Data Package">TDP</abbr> contains technical information
						for the &quot;development, production or use&quot; of an item controlled under the <abbr

							href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-89-202/" rel="external">Export
							Control List</a> (most items under Group 2; Item 5504 under Group 5; and all items under
						Group 6), then the <abbr title="Technical Data Package">TDP</abbr> is also controlled. Refer
						also to a shorter version, published by CGD, of the items that are controlled. If the <abbr
							title="Technical Data Package">TDP</abbr> is designed solely for the solicitation of bids,
						it is probably not controlled. Contracting officers should contact the Export Controls Division,
						<abbr title="Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade">DFAIT</abbr>, at
						613-996-2387, for assistance in making this determination.</li>
					<li>Security precautions for transferring controlled goods will vary, depending on the type and size
						of the controlled goods. Safeguards chosen must adequately preclude the examination and
						unauthorized transfer of controlled goods by a person who is not registered, exempt or excluded
						under the <abbr title="Controlled Goods Program">CGP</abbr> and should be such as to make
						tampering evident. These include:<br>
						<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>using double envelopes, security seals and security-sealed containers;</li>
							<li>marking transfer containers with a return address;</li>
							<li>recording how the controlled good is being transferred;</li>
							<li>determining the reliability of a postal or courier service;</li>
							<li>transferring controlled goods by first class or registered mail, or by a reliable postal
								or courier service that offers: proof of mailing, a record while in transit, and a
								record of delivery;</li>
							<li>recording the controlled good being transferred, who is transferring it, and the

					<h2><a id="section-4.65">4.65 Exchange Rate Fluctuation Risk Mitigation</a></h2>
					<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2017-08-17</time>)</p>
				</header>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>The exchange rate risk on the purchase of materials, components or products from outside Canada
						is generally considered a normal business risk for suppliers. However, in some cases, it may be
						in the interest of Canada to accept the risks and benefits of currency fluctuations. In such
						circumstances, the bidder may be offered the choice to mitigate their risk by having an exchange
						rate fluctuation provision included in the contract.</li>
					<li>When determining if an exchange rate fluctuation provision will be included, contracting
						officers may consider such factors as: the likelihood that currency fluctuations will reduce the
						number of bidders; the duration and value of the contract; previous concerns of suppliers;
						potential impact on prices, and the willingness and/or ability of the client department to
						accept such provision.</li>
					<li>An exchange rate fluctuation provision would not generally be applied to procurements done by
						the European and Washington regions, or procurements on the behalf of the Canadian Commercial
						Corporation. This provision should also not be used with telephone buys nor with cost
						reimbursable contracts (or cost reimbursable items of a contract).</li>
					<li>The solicitation must indicate if an exchange rate fluctuation provision is included as a choice
						for the bidder, and explain clearly how such provision will be applied. The solicitation must
						indicate the method for determining the initial exchange rate. For example the initial exchange
						rate is the Bank of Canada rate published on the solicitation closing date. The Bank of Canada
						publishes its rates each business day by 16:30 Eastern Time (ET).</li>
					<li>The solicitation must also indicate the date to be used in determining the exchange rate for
						adjustment purposes. This will be the rate published by the Bank of Canada on such a date, by
						16:30 <abbr title="Eastern Time">ET</abbr>. It is often preferable to use the delivery date as
						the exchange rate for adjustment purposes. Contracting officers may also choose to use the
						direct shipment date, as indicated on the <a
							href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/forms-formulaires/b3-3-eng.html"
							rel="external">Canada Customs Coding Form</a>, <abbr
							title="Canada Border Services Agency">CBSA</abbr> Form B3-3, or some other date. Contracting
						officers must always ensure that the solicitation (and contract) clearly specifies the method
						for determining the date for the exchange rate for adjustment. Where a modification to a clause
						is required, contracting officers are encouraged to work with the Procurement Process Tools
						Division (<a href="mailto:outilsapprov.proctools@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca"
							rel="external">outilsapprov.proctools@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a>) and legal services to modify
						the appropriate Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual clause. Generally,
						bids must be submitted in Canadian currency.</li>
					<li>Exchange rate fluctuation provisions must be identified in procurement plans, contract requests,
						and Contract Planning and Advance Approvals (CPAA), since it is part of the basis of payment and
						may impact the total contract costs. The client should be informed of and agree with the
						decision to use this provision in the solicitation and the contract. The client should provide a
						buffer in the commitment, or alternatively, be aware that a supplemental section 32
						certification of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/"
							rel="external">Financial Administration Act</a> may become necessary in order for the
						payment to be made. The client project authority may need to inform the department financial
						authority of a potential impact to the commitment. Approval of the procurement/contract does not
						need to be sought again due to any increases in the total contract value resulting from exchange
						rate fluctuation that may occur.</li>
					<li>To have the exchange rate fluctuation provision apply, bidders must identify this choice as per
						the instructions in subsection j. The <dfn><abbr
								title="Foreign Currency Component">FCC</abbr></dfn> is defined as the portion of the
						price or rate that will be directly affected by exchange rate fluctuation. The <abbr
							title="Foreign Currency Component">FCC</abbr> should include all related taxes, duties and
						other costs paid by the supplier and which are to be included in the adjustment amount.</li>
					<li>When bidders are offered the choice to mitigate their risk against the exchange rate
						fluctuation, <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause
						<a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/C/C3010T/active">C3010T</a>
						must be incorporated by reference in the solicitation, and clause <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/C/C3015C/active">C3015C</a>,
						which may be used for various methods of payment such as milestone and cost incurred progress
						payments, must be used in the resulting contract clauses.</li>
					<li>Whenever exchange rate fluctuation is not expected to be an issue, and therefore it is not
						proposed to offer mitigation against it, the <abbr
							title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/C/C3011T/active">C3011T</a>
						must be included in the solicitation to clearly indicate to bidders that a request for exchange
						rate adjustment will not be considered and that inclusion of such request in the bid will render
						the bid non-responsive.</li>
					<li>To have the exchange rate fluctuation provision apply, the bidders must identify this choice and
						clearly indicate the applicable <abbr title="Foreign Currency Component">FCC</abbr>, generally
						in Canadian dollars, and the applicable foreign currency for each line item in the financial
						proposal for which the adjustment will be applied. Bidders may indicate this using form <a
							href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/forms/formulaires-forms-eng.html#f2"
							rel="external">PWGSC-TPSGC 450 Claim for Exchange Rate Adjustments</a>. The <abbr
							title="Foreign Currency Component">FCC</abbr> amount will then be used in the calculation of
						the adjustment amount when invoiced and paid.</li>
					<li>The exchange rate adjustment amount will be calculated by the successful bidder using the
						following formula:<br><dfn>Exchange Rate Adjustment</dfn> = FCC x Qty x ( i<sub>1</sub> -
						i<sub>0</sub> ) / i<sub>0</sub><br>where formula variables correspond to:<dl>
							<dt>FCC</dt>
							<dd>Foreign Currency Component (per unit)</dd>
							<dt>Qty</dt>
							<dd>quantity of units</dd>
							<dt>i<sub>0</sub></dt>
							<dd>initial exchange rate (<abbr title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr> per unit of foreign
								currency [for example <abbr title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr>1])</dd>
							<dt>i<sub>1</sub></dt>
							<dd>exchange rate for adjustment (<abbr title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr> per unit of
								foreign currency [for example <abbr title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr>1])</dd>
						</dl>This calculation may be done for each line item and the sum of adjustments shown as a
						single line item on the invoice.</li>
					<li><strong>Example:</strong> In a solicitation for 100 &quot;regular chairs&quot;, the successful
						bidder bid <abbr title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr>200 per chair and specified an <abbr
							title="Foreign Currency Component">FCC</abbr> for each chair of <abbr
							title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr>100 (50%) representing the initial value of materials
						from the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, including all applicable customs, taxes and
						exchange rate costs which are impacted by the exchange rate. The solicitation specified that the
						initial rate is based on the bid closing date and that the rate for adjustment is based on the
						delivery date. The bid closed on March 1, and on that day, the exchange rate was 1.0000 <abbr
							title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr> per <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> dollar. On
						May 1, when the chairs were delivered, the exchange rate changed significantly to 1.1500 <abbr
							title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr>/<abbr
							title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr>.<br>Calculation:<dl>
							<dt>Exchange Rate Adjustment</dt>
							<dd>= (<abbr title="Foreign Currency Component">FCC</abbr> per unit) x <abbr
									title="Quantity of units">Qty</abbr> x ( i<sub>1</sub> - i<sub>0</sub> ) /
								i<sub>0</sub></dd>
							<dd>= $100 x 100 x (1.1500 <abbr title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr>/<abbr
									title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr> – 1.0000 <abbr
									title="Canadian Dollars">CAN$</abbr>/<abbr title="United States Dollars">US$</abbr>)

						the exchange rate adjustment would be: $1,235.96 representing a reduction in the price paid by
						Canada.<br><strong>Note:</strong> Suppliers should submit a separate calculation sheet for each
						invoice submitted showing the exchange rate adjustment for all line items with an <abbr
							title="Foreign Currency Component">FCC</abbr>.
					</li>
					<li>The exchange rate adjustment will only be applied when the exchange rate fluctuation is greater
						than 2% (increase or decrease), i.e. <abbr title="absolute">abs</abbr>[(i<sub>1</sub> –
						i<sub>0</sub>) / i<sub>0</sub>] &gt; .02, where &quot;abs&quot; represents the absolute value.
					</li>
					<li>The choice by a bidder to mitigate their risk against the exchange rate fluctuation will not
						have an impact on the evaluated price. The exchange rate adjustment is applied at the time of
						payment.</li>
					<li>The client payment office is responsible for ensuring that the adjustment is in accordance with
						the contract provisions.</li>
					<li>Contracting officers must ensure that the initial exchange rate, the <abbr
							title="Foreign Currency Component">FCC</abbr> for each item, and the associated foreign
						currency for each <abbr title="Foreign Currency Component">FCC</abbr> is clearly indicated with
						the prices in the contract to facilitate the payment process.</li>
					<li>Contracting officers must also ensure that the basis of payment clause specifies:<br>&quot;The
						price paid will be adjusted in accordance with the exchange rate fluctuation provision (as
						applicable).&quot;<br><strong>Note:</strong> The words &quot;as applicable&quot; are used, since
						it is the bidder&#39;s choice to include an exchange rate fluctuation provision and the exchange
						rate fluctuation must be greater than 2% (increase or decrease).</li>
					<li><strong>Invoicing:</strong> The supplier must indicate the exchange rate adjustment amount
						(either upward, downward or present no change) as a separate item on each invoice or claim for
						payment submitted under the contract. This must be shown even when there is no adjustment claim
						due to the change in the rate being below the threshold.</li>
					<li>The total estimated cost of the contract must be amended upward, where needed, to address
						changes due to the exchange rate fluctuation. The final contract amendment should amend the
						contract price upward or downward, as needed, to reflect the actual price paid.</li>

							<li>In a contract for the sale of goods, any affirmation of fact or any promise by the

								general conditions do not negate or limit in any way the operation of other relevant
								warranties that are, as a general rule, implied or imposed by law.</li>
							<li>Examples of relevant warranties that are implied by law are:<ol class="double-space"
									type="i">
									<li>the fitness of the goods for the purpose intended; or</li>
									<li>the merchantable quality of the goods.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>These warranties are implied in most contracts for the sale of goods through the
								<cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-20.4/index.html"
										rel="external">International Sale of Goods Contracts Convention Act</a></cite>,
								a version of which exists in all Canadian provinces and territories except Quebec. In
								Quebec, the warranty under the Civil Code is a warranty of ownership and of quality,
								which includes latent defects.</li>
							<li>The contracting officer may negotiate an increase to the warranty time period in a
								contract, subject to client department agreement to the proposed time period and related
								cost. This change in warranty time period should be addressed in the contract approval
								document.</li>
							<li>Any requests for lessening Canada&#39;s full rights at law, a disclaimer, limitation of
								the contractor&#39;s liability, or decrease of the warranty time period, must be
								reviewed by Legal Services, be acceptable to the client department, and form part of the
								contract approval document.</li>
							<li>It may be necessary to consider obtaining a broader warranty than that contemplated by
								the warranty provision appearing in the <abbr
									title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3">general

							<li>These are cases where the same or similar defects have developed in several identical
								items of finished work, or components, and it is reasonable to assume that the same
								defects will be found in the total quantity of such items, which have already been
								delivered, or will be delivered.</li>
							<li>Where this type of warranty is requested by the client department, or considered
								desirable by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>, the
								contracting officer, in consultation with the client department, must determine the
								extent and nature of the warranty required, and request Legal Services to prepare a
								suitable provision to cover the requirement. In the case of negotiated firm price
								contracts, the contracting officer must obtain the client department&#39;s agreement to
								the estimated cost of this warranty.</li>
							<li>The general conditions provide that contractors must carry out warranty work at their
								own expense. The following interpretations apply:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>in the case of firm price contracts awarded as a result of a competitive
										solicitation, where the procurement process precludes any adjustment to the
										price quoted, costs incurred as a consequence of warranty consideration must be
										the responsibility of the contractor;</li>
									<li>in the case of negotiated firm price contracts, where contingency for warranty
										work becomes a factor for consideration during the price negotiations, the
										amount included in the firm price must be kept to reasonable levels, and must be
										specifically approved. Supporting details must be part of the cost summary
										presented in the contract approval document;</li>
									<li>in the case of negotiated firm price contracts governed by the <cite><a
												href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-1/"
												rel="external">Defence Production Act</a></cite>, the contractor must
										certify that the price is based on costs computed in accordance with Contract
										Cost Principles <a
											href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a>,
										which do not permit any increase in reserves for guaranteed work. Therefore,
										costs for work and/or expenses in order to provide for product
										correction/adjustment/replacement under warranty requirements, are not to be
										included in the contract price since provision for these expenses has already
										been included in the certified price;</li>
									<li>in cost reimbursable contracts, the contractor is not allowed to charge any
										contingency for warranty as an element of cost. If the contractor is required to
										make good under the warranty provisions, the contracting officer may allow
										recovery of the reasonable cost incurred for direct labour and direct material
										only. There is to be no allowance for overhead or profit;</li>
									<li>if the contracting officer is of the opinion that reasonable warranty costs may
										be allowed, then an appropriate clause approved by Legal Services must be
										inserted in the contract to authorize such costs. The contract should contain a
										line item providing for the allowance of costs, with or without a maximum
										estimated expenditure.</li>

									<li>Firm price does not help build or maintain contractor relationships due to

									<li>Contractors are awarded a premium for Firm Price at the beginning of a contract.

							<li>The <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s

								of payment. The Procurement Support Services Sector may also be contacted for further
								guidance.</li>
							<li>Historically, firm price provided a price, which was not subject to adjustment for
								performance of the contract or part of it. It gave maximum profit incentive to the
								contractor for cost control in that the contractor assumed full responsibility for all
								costs under or over the firm price. In addition, it placed a minimum administrative
								burden on both contracting parties. See <abbr

							</li>
							<li>This basis of payment was used to buy commercially available goods or readily
								quantifiable services when:<br>
								<ol type="i">
									<li>the contractor had previously manufactured the particular good or provided the
										particular service, or similar goods or services, and had sufficient experience
										to permit a realistic statement of work based on firm specifications;</li>
									<li>the statement of work could have a cost applied to it in terms of quantities of
										material and labour time required; and</li>
									<li>a realistic estimate of the material prices and labour and overhead rates
										applicable during the contract period could be made.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Subsequent to the negotiation of a firm price basis of payment for a non-competitive
								requirement, the contractor must resubmit the price bid based on the agreement reached.
							</li>
							<li>A discretionary audit clause may be included in the contract, as appropriate, subject to
								the receipt of a price certification in accordance with <abbr

							<li>The <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
									Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 4.1.1 Fixed Price, provides further
								guidance on the decision process, procedures, and examples for use of this basis of
								payment type.</li>
							<li>Fixed price provides price certainty throughout the life of a contract. In a fixed price
								contract, the contractor is paid a definite sum of money for carrying out the work
								regardless of the costs incurred. It gives maximum profit incentive to the contractor
								for cost control in that the contractor assumes full responsibility for all costs under
								or over the fixed price. In addition, it places a minimum administrative burden on both
								contracting parties. See <abbr

									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/C/C8000C/active">C8000C</a>.
							</li>
							<li>Options for this basis of payment are:<ol type="i">
									<li>fixed price competitive: price is established by market competition with more
										than one compliant bidder. A competitive fixed price is the optimal basis of
										payment for achieving value because it is based on business profit motives. With
										multiple compliant bidders, the contracting officer is generally afforded a high
										degree of comfort that the price being fixed is fair market value;</li>
									<li>fixed price non-competitive: price is negotiated at the outset of the contract
										or in an amendment to the contract; and</li>
									<li>fixed price subject to economic price adjustment: price includes the ability to
										adjust for significant fluctuations of price outside of Canada and the
										contractor’s control (see Section 4.2 Economic Price Adjustments and Foreign
										Currency Adjustments of the <a
											href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
											Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>).</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Use this basis of payment when:<ol type="i">
									<li>The contracting officer has a significant level of assurance that the price
										being fixed is fair and will not result in unreasonable profits being paid by
										Canada. This assurance can be obtained through:<ol type="A">
											<li>a competitive procurement with multiple compliant bidders, which allows
												the market to set the price.</li>
											<li>sufficient benchmarking and should-cost information to validate the
												price.</li>
											<li>available historical data on costing that is robust enough to be able to
												validate the price prior to fixing it. With a follow on contract, for
												example, assurance services can be performed on the costs and profit of
												the previous contract to establish a fixed price in the follow on
												contract.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>the requirements, scope of work and outputs to determine the level of effort are
										known, clearly defined and are unlikely to change. (e.g., where the relevant
										technology, industry, platform, or service is mature or proven).</li>
									<li>the contract duration is short to medium-term to ensure that:<ol type="A">
											<li>the price would not need to include additional profit premiums to
												account for long-term requirements and cost uncertainties.</li>
											<li>the contracting officer has a reasonable level of assurance that the
												price will still be reasonable and of value to Canada in the later years
												of the contract given the potential for technology changes and process
												improvements.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>the schedule is relatively certain and considered achievable.</li>
									<li>it is appropriate for the contractor to bear the risk of cost uncertainty.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>A fixed price basis of payment may not be appropriate for high risk procurements
								involving contracts with highly uncertain or variable scopes. For example: cutting edge,
								untested or developmental technology.</li>
							<li>There is no discretionary audit clause in a fixed price contract, which means that once
								a contract is signed, the contracting officer no longer has the ability to validate the
								costs and profit being earned on a contract during the contract or at contract
								completion for the purposes of excess profit recovery.</li>
							<li>Ensure as part of the validation strategy, that Canada retains it’s right to audit for
								information purposes related to potential future negotiations on interim or follow-on
								contracts. This should include the right to audit the underlying costs, including the
								cost of production, to produce the necessary level of price support needed to determine
								if the fixed price is fair and reasonable. General audit clauses/conditions are a part
								of the general conditions template for low, medium and high complexity procurements.

							<li>This basis of payment provides for the payment to the contractor for the actual hours

							</li>
							<li>Cost reimbursable pricing is primarily used when there is uncertainty as to the scope
								and requirements of the work. Cost reimbursable pricing is generally used in negotiated
								contracts. It may not provide much encouragement for a contractor to limit costs unless

									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s

									<li>adequate government resources are in place to manage a cost reimbursable
										contract, which includes resources to review and validate costs claimed;</li>
									<li>appropriate validation mechanisms exist during the contract performance and

							<li>This basis of payment is a form of gain or pain sharing, where cost efficiencies or
								losses are rewarded and shared through fee arrangements in which both the contractor and
								Canada share the reward (risk) of meeting (or not meeting) contract performance
								criteria. In effect, the gain or pain sharing formula in this basis of payment
								encourages the contractor to control their costs. Setting targets and percentages for
								gain/pain sharing formulas should involve determining the likelihood of variations from
								the established target. Actual experience may indicate that the contractor’s underlying
								business solution or Canada’s requirements have changed to the point where the sharing
								agreement and the contract should be amended.</li>
							<li>Use this basis of payment when the criteria required for a fixed or firm price basis of
								payment are lacking and the goods and services being acquired are of a nature that the
								assumption by the contractor of a degree of cost responsibility is likely to provide a
								positive incentive for effective cost control and contract performance.</li>
							<li>There are two primary target cost/incentive fee basis of payment types. For additional

							<li>When a cost reimbursable with a target cost/incentive fee basis of payment is used, it
								may be necessary to negotiate in advance a target cost, a target fee, a maximum fee and

								basis of payment type.</li>
							<li>This cost reimbursable basis of payment option provides for the payment to the
								contractor for the actual amount of costs incurred in performance of the work. The
								actual amount of costs incurred in performance of the work may be subject to government
								audit. While the fixed fee does not vary with actual costs incurred, it may be
								renegotiated under certain circumstances. Refer to <abbr
									title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/C/C0202C/active">C0202C</a>.
							</li>
							<li>Use this basis of payment when circumstances do not permit the use of a fixed price and
								where the possible savings from the use of a cost reimbursable with target
								cost/incentive fee contract are likely to be offset by the complexities of contract
								administration resulting from its use. It is primarily used in research and advanced
								development or in projects where the required level of effort is unknown.</li>
							<li>The amount of the fixed fee, based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred, should be
								no greater than the appropriate amount of profit. See <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
									Guide for Procurement Pricing</a> Section 5.2 Profit Principles for guidance on the
								determination of profit. If it is not possible for both parties to reach agreement on an
								estimate of the costs to be incurred, as a basis for calculating the fixed fee, swing
								points are used. Swing points are the amounts of estimated costs, one higher and one
								lower than the amount used for the calculation of the fixed fee, at which the fixed fee
								will be renegotiated.</li>
							<li>In a contract or part of a contract with this basis of payment, which include a ceiling
								price, the contractor must complete the prescribed work without additional payment,
								whether or not actual costs exceed the ceiling price. When a ceiling price is used,
								there must be full agreement between the parties as to what constitutes the prescribed
								work. <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual

								must be used in a ceiling price contract where it is necessary to ensure against the
								contractor making changes or carrying out additional work without the prior approval of
								the contracting officer. If it is possible to determine the prescribed work and for the
								parties to agree on an estimated amount to complete it as a basis for the ceiling price,
								it may be appropriate to use another basis of payment, that is, one which provides for a

							<li>The <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
									Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 4.1.4 Provisional Price Basis of Payment,
								provides further guidance on the decision process, procedures, and examples for use of
								this basis of payment type.</li>
							<li>In a provisional price basis of payment, a contract begins with a cost reimbursable
								basis of payment when the requirements and costs within the contract are uncertain or
								cannot be estimated, with a clearly defined price ceiling or limitation of expenditure.
							</li>
							<li>This basis of payment is used when there is a plan to move from a cost reimbursable
								basis of payment to a fixed price basis of payment because there will be an increased
								certainty in terms of the contract requirements over time, which therefore decreases the
								risks to Canada for the remainder of the contract. Provisional pricing gives contracting
								officers the ability to reduce the risks to Canada when they are able to better analyze
								and evaluate appropriate, attributable and reasonable cost.</li>
							<li>Provisional price requires a milestone to be established that is relevant to the level
								of uncertainty for the requirement. This milestone is typically tied to a certain
								percentage of work completed or achievement of critical performance indicators within
								the contract when the costs are more certain and stable. This would predefine when the
								cost reimbursable portion is complete and the basis of payment can move to fixed price.
								This must be clearly detailed in the contract.</li>
							<li>The price validation is triggered when the contractor submits a declaration of the
								percentage of work completed that corresponds to the milestone. This declaration must
								include a cost submission prepared by the contractor (please refer to <abbr
									title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/C/C0300C/active">C0300C</a>).
								Costs must be validated before the basis of payment is formally changed to a fixed
								price.</li>
							<li>Contractors must cooperate in a timely manner with auditors and provide all necessary
								supporting evidence such as financial information, as and when required by auditors. The
								submission of all costs incurred must be sufficient to disclose unit cost and cost
								trends for the goods and/or services performed in relation to the contract and
								inventories of both work in progress and undelivered contract supplies on-hand.
								Benchmarking by market data or historical data on costs and profit calculation is also
								included in the price validation process. The use of expertise within Procurement
								Support Services Sector to validate the price is highly recommended.</li>
							<li>When the milestone is attained and the costs become more certain and stable, Canada and
								the contractor will negotiate a fixed price for the remainder of the contract based on
								the terms and conditions outlined in the initial contract.</li>
							<li>Typically, provisional pricing is used in longer-term contracts, such as five (5) years
								or longer, where it is not possible to fix the price due to uncertainty, or where there
								is an inability to set reasonable estimates or targets on contract requirements and
								costs.</li>
							<li>Provisional pricing enables contracting officers to work towards the benefits of a fixed
								price, such as cost efficiencies, transfer of risk to the contractor, and reduction of
								the administrative burden that existed during the period where the contract had a cost
								reimbursable basis of payment. A cost-benefit analysis could help to reveal the
								potential value in using provisional pricing.</li>

						<li>Contract performance means the fulfillment or accomplishment of the work that is required
							under the contract. For additional guidance on incentives, see the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a>, section 4.4 Incentives and the following Discussion Papers
							in section 6.0 Annexes, Annex 5.2 on performance management:<ul>

								</li>
								<li>Annex 5.2.2 – Measures to Manage Contractor Non-Compliance or Unacceptable Behavior
								</li>
								<li>Annex 5.2.4 – Managing Long-Term Contractual Relationships.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>An incentive is a tool used in contracting to maximize value to both the Government of
							Canada and the contractor by motivating and rewarding the achievement of Canada’s desired
							outcomes, when appropriate. Incentives can be both short-term to achieve specific goals or
							long-term to encourage the sustainment of behaviours.</li>
						<li>Incentives can be used in both competitive and non competitive procurements:<ol type="i">
								<li>when it comes to competitive contracts, it is recommended that incentives be
									introduced in the solicitation, as part of the resulting contract clauses. If there
									are uncertainties in terms of the application of incentives, specific incentive
									parameters can be stated in the solicitation.</li>
								<li>with respect to non-competitive contracts, incentives can be introduced during
									negotiations of a contract price and applied anytime throughout the life of a
									contract.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Incentives may not be appropriate or effective for all contracts, particularly when:<ol
								type="i">
								<li>The contractor will achieve the target performance criteria without an incentive;
								</li>
								<li>The contractor will not be motivated by the incentives to achieve the target
									performance criteria; or</li>
								<li>There is minimal to no value to Canada for the contract to perform beyond the base
									standards established in the statement of requirements.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Incentives can be used with all basis of payment types to reward superior contract
							performance which exceeds the base standards established in the Statement of
							Requirement/Work and provides value to Canada.</li>
						<li>The performance objectives or outcomes associated with the incentive should be balanced and
							aligned to the most important objectives of the procurement. Rewarding a contractor for
							simply meeting the contract requirement should be avoided.</li>
						<li>Incentives should be challenging and add value to a procurement when achieved. It is
							important to avoid incentives that are easily achieved and don’t add value to the
							procurement, but also to note that when incentives are too challenging and difficult to
							achieve, a contractor may be discouraged to invest the effort and cost required to achieve
							the performance.</li>
						<li>An assessment is needed to ensure the incentive(s) will, in fact, motivate a contractor to
							perform. This will vary by contractor based on many factors including but not limited to
							basis of ownership, size, diversification, and organizational culture.</li>
						<li>Consideration should be given to whether or not the contractor has control over the
							achievement of the incentives and whether the performance objectives can be measured and
							verified, which includes ensuring that the contractor’s systems can adequately track the
							information required for measurement.</li>
						<li>The benefits of the contract outcomes should exceed the combined cost of the incentives and
							cost of their administration to all parties.</li>
						<li>The structure and administration of incentives should be as simple as possible. Simple,
							limited, high level objective measurements are preferred over complex multi-variable
							algorithms. This includes avoiding the use of too many incentives in a single contract. Too
							many incentives dilutes the focus and makes it more likely for the Government of Canada to
							pay for unintended outcomes. See the section on Multiple Incentives and Competing Objectives
							in section 4.4 Incentives of the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a>.</li>
						<li>If there are unstable market conditions and the procurement includes the use of an Economic
							Price Adjustment (EPA) or Foreign Currency Adjustment (FCA), the <abbr
								title="Economic Price Adjustment">EPA</abbr> or <abbr
								title="Foreign Currency Adjustment">FCA</abbr> must be excluded from determining the
							incentives.</li>
						<li>The involvement and active communication with all stakeholders including program, technical,
							acquisition, and price advisors in the incentive planning process is essential. In addition,
							modelling of the impact and value of incentive programs from both the Government of Canada
							and the Contractor perspectives is essential.</li>
						<li>Incentives may modify contractor behaviour. In order to ensure the behaviour modification is
							planned and welcomed, it is imperative that the contract structure, including basis of
							payment, statement of work, and performance management plans, be developed considering the
							perspective of both the Government of Canada and the contractor. An incentive plan that is
							not informed by all parties and perspectives can result in unintended consequences on a
							procurement.</li>
						<li>There are a number of incentive options available. The following is a list of incentives for
							which additional guidance has been provided in the <a

								this incentive type.</li>
							<li>Technical performance incentives include the technical goals that have to be achieved in
								performing the contract and to bring value to Canada. These goals can be expressed in
								the form of technical criteria as well as specifications and requirements. Incorporating
								technical performance incentives in a contract aims to achieve and/or improve technical
								parameters related to the procurement that are of critical importance to Canada. Upon
								achievement of one or more specified levels of technical performance, the contractor is
								provided with the opportunity to earn additional profit.</li>
							<li>Technical performance incentives can be used when performance excellence and
								improvements would add value or are of critical importance to the procurement and to
								Canada (e.g. quality and technical ingenuity). Predetermined, objective and measurable
								incentive targets applicable to technical performance need to be established to use this
								incentive.</li>
							<li>Technical performance incentives begin by developing and defining performance criteria
								and parameters related to contract technical specifications. The benefit to Canada of

							<li>Schedule performance incentives involve rewarding the achievement of incentivised

							<li>Schedule performance incentives begin with the establishment of realistic delivery dates
								and clear criteria to be met. The delivery incentive can be based on successful delivery
								on a single target date or a target date range (where the earlier the completion of

									Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>, section 4.4.3 Award Fees, provides further
								guidance on the decision process, procedures, and examples for use of this incentive
								type.</li>
							<li>Award fee incentives are used to motivate contractors to perform in areas critical to a
								procurement’s success that are subject to judgment and qualitative measurement and
								evaluation. The award fee incentive is a pool of funds, up to a maximum of which the
								contractor can earn, in addition to any profit or base-fee, upon an evaluation of
								performance against pre-established criteria.</li>
							<li>Award fees can be used as an incentive when there is something to be gained by
								motivating excellence in performance including quality, expediency, technical ingenuity
								and cost-effective management. The contract amount, performance period, and expected
								benefits should warrant the cost of the additional administrative and management effort
								of using award fees. This incentive is chosen over other types when evaluating
								performance that is subjective in nature and it is not feasible to determine objective
								incentive targets applicable to cost, schedule, or technical performance.</li>
							<li>Award fees require a plan that details the structure of how a contractor’s performance
								will be evaluated and should be aligned with Canada’s strategy, goals, and objectives
								for the procurement. The plan must clearly communicate the key factors within an award
								fee incentive, which includes the award fee amount and evaluation details such as
								evaluation periods, teams, categories, criteria, ratings and process.</li>
							<li>Development of the award fee amount must incorporate the following factors:<ol type="i">
									<li>value to Canada for exceptional performance;</li>
									<li>amount required to sufficiently motivate the contractor to achieve exceptional
										performance; and</li>
									<li>complexity of the work and the resources required for contract performance.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Award fees are earned by meeting predetermined evaluation criteria.</li>
							<li>Award fees can be evaluated in a single evaluation period or throughout multiple
								evaluation periods. An evaluation team with the appropriate technical and procurement
								expertise should be established.</li>
							<li>Performance categories and the associated evaluation criteria and ratings should be
								developed with point or score ranges assigned to each criterion. The overall score for
								each performance category is determined by the total points earned from each criterion
								within the category.</li>
							<li>A clear evaluation process should be established and documented to define the evaluation
								periods, how evaluation information will be gathered, and how often information will be
								obtained for review. It is important to also establish a communication process for the
								evaluation process and results, including required response times. The evaluation
								process is outlined in <abbr

					</header>
					<p>The method of payment is the way Canada will pay for work performed or goods delivered, such as
						all arrears (preferred), in advance, as a lot delivery or as each item are delivered. Different
						types of methods of payment are described below:</p>

							<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2010-01-11</time>)</p>
						</header>
						<p>Canada pays for work performed or goods received under a contract in accordance with
							Canada&#39;s standard payment period of 30 days as provided in the general conditions. The
							general conditions also reflect Canada&#39;s policy to automatically pay interest to
							contractors when an account is overdue and Canada is responsible for the delay. When dealing
							with federally or provincially regulated public utility companies, the conditions for
							payment of interest must conform to those approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies. The
							provisions for payment of interest on overdue accounts set out in the general conditions
							must be strictly adhered to, except in special cases where the client department requisition
							specifies a payment period longer than 30 days; for example, when extensive product
							evaluation, inspection or testing requirements are involved. In such cases, the general
							conditions may be modified subject to consultation Legal Services.</p>

							<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2010-01-11</time>)</p>
						</header>
						<p>The most appropriate method of payment must be determined based on the particular
							procurement. Some of the factors for consideration are the following:</p>
						<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>Risk exposure for Canada, if situations such as insolvency, work cancellation or work
								default occurs. Pertinent factors include:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>Can securing unconditional guarantees protect an advance payment or performance
										bonds from financial institutions or from associated or parent companies with
										good financial credentials?</li>
									<li>What is the likely marketability and resale value of work-in-process to which
										Canada acquires title by virtue of making progress payments? The disparity
										between the amount of progress payments and the resale value of inventory is a
										measure of the risk exposure for Canada.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Financing Cost Estimates: Since provision for progress payments or advance payments
								involves a real or imputed cost to Canada, this cost should be calculated for each of
								the available options. Apply the chartered bank prime lending rate, as advised
								periodically by the Director, Cost and Forensic Accounting Directorate, to the
								cumulative net financing (that is, cumulative cash payout by Canada minus cumulative
								value of deliveries under the contract), using reasonable assumptions regarding work
								progress and item deliveries.</li>
							<li>The potential reduction in contract price resulting from the various methods of payment.
							</li>
							<li>Since progress payments or advance payments reduce the need for borrowing by the
								contractor, or reduce the size of equity capital on which a return must be realized,
								lower prices should flow through to Canada. The price reduction will vary with the
								different methods of payment and their relative attractiveness to the contractor.</li>
							<li>Financial circumstances that may affect the ability of the client department to finance
								the various options.</li>

									</li>
									<li>Progress Payments and Advance Payments: In all cases, a payment cannot be made
										in the current fiscal year for a contract that will not start until the next
										fiscal year. The requirement that payment be made only for goods or services
										received in the same fiscal year may require modification of the method of
										payment for requirements whose period of delivery or service spans fiscal years.
										Specifically, it may be necessary to provide for multiple payments, at the
										appropriate point in the contract period.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Progress payments or advance payments may be considered only if all of the following
								conditions are met:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>adequate security for the payment is ensured;</li>
									<li>Canada receives value commensurate with the amount of the payment;</li>
									<li>the client department has adequate funds to provide the financing; and</li>
									<li>one of the following circumstances exists:<ol class="double-space" type="A">
											<li>There is economic advantage to Canada that clearly outweighs the
												financing cost associated with the progress payment or advance payment.
											</li>
											<li>The contractor could suffer hardship or provide financing only with
												difficulty or at rates considered to be uneconomical in relation to
												prevailing chartered bank prime lending rates.</li>
											<li>The value of the contract is considered to be beyond the assessed
												financial capabilities of the contractor.</li>
											<li>There is to be a long duration for contract performance; orthere is an
												entrenched tradition or practice of receiving progress payments or
												advance payments from the purchaser in a particular industry or segment
												of industry. However, payments can only be made for goods or services
												received in the same fiscal year. Funds must be spent in the fiscal year
												for which they are appropriated and cannot be carried forward by means
												of advance payments.</li>
											<li>In the case of subscriptions or insurance premiums, which are often for
												a term of one full year and which may not start exactly on April 1,
												payments can be restricted to goods or services provided in no more than
												the current and next fiscal years. For instance, a publication
												subscription paid in February 2009 cannot cover a period beyond
												March 2010.</li>
											<li>In the case of multi-year contracts requiring continuing advances,
												contracting officers can negotiate the payment of a series of separate
												advances covering each fiscal year. Thus, a payment can be made for a
												maintenance contract, for the period of a contract, from February to
												March 2009, and then another payment covering the period from
												April 2009 to March 2010.</li>
											<li>In exceptional situations, such as armament purchases or extended
												warranty service, where up-front payments covering more than one fiscal
												year must be made to the supplier, contracting officers can determine if
												an advance payment is unavoidable and can be substantiated. This type of

							<li>Special Considerations for Foreign Purchases:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>in the case of United States purchases, progress payments or other payments on

										place of ownership being transferred to Canada. Legal Services should be
										consulted to ensure that appropriate terms in the contract protect against
										unnecessary taxes;</li>
									<li>for other foreign purchases, where progress payments or other payments on
										account are granted, a check should be made to determine if the application of
										sales, use, or some other form of tax is related to the time and place of
										ownership being transferred to Canada. If this is the case, Legal Services must

								determined by government audit, is to provide a basis for such certification of the

							<li>Contracts containing cost reimbursable elements must contain an appropriate audit
								clause. The cost reimbursable bases of payment are: cost reimbursable with fixed time

								reimbursable with fee based on actual costs; and cost reimbursable with no fee.</li>
							<li>Upon completion of a cost reimbursable contract, the contractor will be required to
								provide a cost submission to the contracting officer. The requirement for a cost
								submission must be listed as a mandatory deliverable item within the contract, except
								that it is discretionary in the case of repair and overhaul contracts. (See <abbr

					</header>
					<ol class="double-space" type="a">
						<li>Limiting a contractor&#39;s liability should be an exception to the normal practice of using
							the standard conditions. When the decision is made to limit a contractor&#39;s liability to
							Canada, contracting officers, in conjunction with departments, must be able to demonstrate
							that the risks associated with the procurement have been analyzed and that the limitation of
							liability provides adequate protection to Canada. For more information on risk management,
							consult <a href="#section-3">Chapter 3 - Procurement Strategy</a>. Decisions with respect to
							limiting a contractor&#39;s liability should be made before the solicitation release or, in
							instances of non-competitive contracts, before the start of negotiations.<br>When limitation
							of liability applies to a requirement, <abbr
								title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual limitation of
							liability clauses may be included in the contract. The applicable dollar amount in the
							clause is to be determined from the appropriate commodity grouping (usually &quot;the
							Contract Price at the time the damage occurs&quot; or a pre-determined dollar amount
							established by the commodity grouping).</li>
						<li>When limiting a contractor&#39;s liability to Canada, but not limiting each party&#39;s
							liability for damages to third parties, clause <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/N/N0001C/active">N0001C</a>
							must be used. Typically, this clause would be used when a commodity grouping exists (other
							than <abbr title="Information Management/Information Technology">IM/IT</abbr> or satellite
							services, which have their own clauses) or after a risk assessment has been performed to
							determine the risk exposure and amount of protection required by Canada.</li>
						<li>When limiting a contractor&#39;s liability to Canada and requiring the contractor to
							indemnify Canada against third party claims, clause <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/N/N0002C/active">N0002C</a>
							must be used.</li>
						<li>Clauses <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/N/N0001C/active">N0001C</a>
							and <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/N/N0002C/active">N0002C</a>
							are similar, in that both create a limit on the contractor&#39;s liability for damages to
							Canada. However, the two clauses deal with the contractor&#39;s liability for claims made by
							third parties in different ways. <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/N/N0001C/active">N0001C</a>
							essentially provides that the parties agree to allow the laws in the jurisdiction of the
							contract to determine who is responsible for any damages to third parties. It then goes on
							to provide that, if Canada must pay the third party for damages caused by the contractor
							because of joint and several liability, the contractor must reimburse Canada for that
							amount. In short, under clause <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/N/N0001C/active">N0001C</a>,
							each party is responsible for any damages that it causes to third parties. On the other
							hand, clause <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/N/N0002C/active">N0002C</a>
							states that the contractor must indemnify Canada against any third party claims that relate
							to the contract.</li>
						<li>When limiting a contractor&#39;s liability to Canada for first and third party claims,
							clause <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/N/N0003C/active">N0003C</a>
							must be used.</li>
						<li>Limiting a contractor&#39;s liability to Canada for third party claims should be avoided, as
							the exposure of risk to Canada could be extensive. Limiting a contractor&#39;s third party
							liability can only be done under a very limited number of circumstances, generally in
							situations concerning non-competitive contracts. When the decision is made to limit a
							contractor&#39;s third party liability, the appropriate approvals must be sought as follows:
							<ol class="double-space" type="i">
								<li>Limiting contractor’s third party liability <strong>without a substantive transfer
										of risk</strong> requires approval by Director, Acquisitions Program,
									Headquarters, responsible for the area/commodity; and</li>
								<li>Limiting contractor’s third party liability <strong>with a substantive transfer of
										risk</strong> requires Treasury Board (TB) approval, through the Assistant
									Deputy Minister (ADM), Procurement Branch, or <abbr
										title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr>, Defence and Marine Procurement,
									and the department’s <abbr title="Chief Financial Officer">CFO</abbr> approval.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>For the satellite services requirements where special authority was granted by the <abbr

						is made and kept for audit purposes. This is to ensure that a bid/offer/arrangement cannot be
						altered. As evidence that the documents (paper versions) were processed and verified, all

					<li>An assessment of this other location will be carried out by bid receiving personnel, in
						consultation with departmental security personnel, to ensure the complete physical security of
						bids/offers/arrangements from the time of receipt to the time of opening. The personnel of the
						bid receiving location are responsible for recording bids/offers/arrangements received at these
						locations.</li>
					<li>When bids/offers/arrangements are solicited by telephone, the contracting officer must

									<li>At the same time, the procurement risk assessment will also identify the

									<li>Approval of the revised procurement strategy is required even if the risk

					<li>For procurements that are subject to the international trade agreements and the Canadian Free

							<li>The federal government does not pay <abbr

							<li>Persons selling to federal departments may not quote the federal government&#39;s

							<li>Contracting officers should take special care when dealing with the following:<ol
									class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>ancillary taxes: The federal government has agreed to pay certain ancillary
										provincial taxes. These taxes apply to specific goods and services, and their
										applicability varies from province to province. In addition, departments will
										reimburse third parties for <abbr title="Provincial Sales Tax">PST</abbr> paid
										for goods or services purchased on behalf of a department or during work-related

									<li>fuel taxes: Liquid fuels may be taxed in certain provinces under the provincial
										fuel tax or under provincial retail sales tax, depending on the end use. Under
										certain circumstances, liquid fuel may be exempt from provincial tax;</li>
									<li>construction contracts: In all contracts for the construction or repair of a
										building or structure, the contractor is declared to be the consumer of any
										materials used. The contractor usually is not registered as a supplier, and must
										pay tax on purchases of materials. <abbr title="Provincial Sales Tax">PST</abbr>
										is an element of cost to the contractor, and as such is included in the price to
										<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>. No
										further <abbr title="Provincial Sales Tax">PST</abbr> is imposed on the
										transaction between the contractor and <abbr
											title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Construction contracts should not contain a mix of &quot;real property&quot; and
								&quot;tangible personal property&quot;. If unavoidable, the use of the license numbers
								applies only to the acquisition of the &quot;tangible personal property&quot; component
								of the requirement.</li>
							<li>In contracts for the supply and installation of equipment that remains free standing,
								and is affixed to a building or structure for purposes other than providing a direct
								service to such building or structure, the <abbr title="Provincial Sales Tax">PST</abbr>
								is not to be included in the contract price, and the license number or certificate
								should be quoted in the contract. In New Brunswick, such contracts are treated as real
								property contracts and, therefore, are subject to the procedure, outlined in the
								preceding paragraph.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>United States Sales Tax, Use Tax and Personal Property Tax<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>When there is a possibility that United States-based suppliers may be submitting
								responses, contracting officers must specify in the solicitation that prices do not
								include any United States Sales Tax or Use Tax, from which exports are exempted. Any
								resulting contract awarded to a foreign-based contractor must include <abbr
									title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/C/C2000C">C2000C</a>.
							</li>
							<li>Items exported from the United States of America (U.S.A.) by the purchaser, are entitled
								to exemption from state Sales and Use Taxes. Care should be taken to ensure that such
								procurements are not taxed in error.</li>
							<li>Particular care is required in dealing with the State of California, which has Sales,
								Use and Personal Property taxes that may affect <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> procurement.</li>
							<li>In these procedures, the State of California is highlighted because of its stringent tax
								requirements. Similar precautions should be taken to deal with requirements in the other
								states.</li>
							<li>California Sales and Use taxes (Cal Tax) are collected by the seller from the purchaser
								and, if applicable, will require the contract to provide for payment of the tax. The Use
								Tax is not payable on items for which Sales Tax is payable.</li>
							<li>Items exported outside the State by the purchaser are exempt from Cal Tax but, as
								California law is very precise about what constitutes an export, contracting officers
								should ensure that procurement in California is considered an export by the State.</li>
							<li>For example, goods may not be subject to Cal Tax if:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
									<li>they are delivered California <abbr
											title="Foreign Currency Adjustment">FCA</abbr> Free Carrier (...named place)
										with title passing upon such delivery, and are shipped to a point outside
										California; or</li>
									<li>title passes at time of delivery, and the goods are delivered by the seller to a
										conveyance furnished by the purchaser (for example, where they are picked up by
										the Canadian Armed Forces), and are shipped to a point outside the <abbr
											title="United States of America">U.S.A.</abbr></li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>California Personal Property tax is assessed against work-in-process, finished work and
								baled items, title to which is vested in either <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> or the contractor,
								which are located in California at 12:00 o&#39;clock noon on the first Monday in March
								on an annual basis. It is immaterial whether such items relate to a fixed price or cost
								reimbursable type of contract.</li>
							<li>Contracting officers should confirm the manner in which California contractors charge
								the Personal Property Tax on <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracts. If the
								tax is charged as a direct charge to the <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contract, there
								should not also be an indirect charge, and overhead should not be applied to the direct
								charge.</li>
							<li>Another area for particular attention is the use of progress payments or advance
								payments. California taxes may be payable when ownership is transferred to the purchaser
								- and this transfer of ownership may be declared by the State to take place when the
								progress payment or advance payment is made. Contracting officers should ensure that
								ownership is not transferred until the goods are delivered.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Purchases from the State of California<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>The State of California has a sales and use tax, which a supplier must apply to goods
								when title to the goods is transferred to the purchaser in the State and the goods will
								be used in the State. However, imports and exports are not taxed. The use tax is the
								same as the sales tax but the use tax is the one that applies when the goods are
								purchased by an out-of-state entity for use in the state.</li>
							<li>To be exempt as an export, the good sold must be intended for a destination in a foreign
								country and actually delivered to the foreign country before making any use of the
								property. This means that the sales and use tax will not apply when the good pursuant to
								the contract is shipped to Canada. Therefore, if Canada desires to have title to the
								goods transferred in California, the contract must state that the goods are to be
								shipped to Canada and are for use in Canada only. Canada can still take title in
								California and also be responsible for loss of goods during transport.</li>
							<li>If the contract provides for progress or advance payments or if the goods are to be left
								in California for a period of time, Canada&#39;s normal contract provisions would cause
								the sales and use tax to be payable since ownership would be transferred to Canada
								before delivery of the goods. Therefore, in order for Canada to avoid paying this sales
								tax, it must ensure that ownership will not be transferred until delivery of the goods.
							</li>
							<li>To avoid paying the use tax inappropriately, the following <abbr
									title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clauses
								should be included in the contract: <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/D/D4003C">D4003C</a>,

				<ol>
					<li>Overview<br>An exempt supply is not taxable. Thus, a supplier does not collect the Goods and
						Services Tax or the Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) on sales of exempt supplies. The supplier is
						not eligible for any input tax credits on purchases related to the exempt supply. As a result,
						the supplier passes on to the consumer the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr
							title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> that the supplier has paid, as part of the overhead.
						This is where exempt supplies differ from zero-rated supplies. The following are exempt
						supplies.<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>Health and dental services (only services performed for medical or reconstructive
								purposes are exempt. Services performed for cosmetic reasons are not exempt.) This

								service bodies. These are exempt except for exclusions given in Schedule V, Part VI,

							<li>On November 5, 1992, Ontario Bill 40 received royal assent. Included in the legislation
								were certain amendments to the <cite>Employment Standards Act</cite> (ESA) intended to
								protect the jobs and the level of benefits of workers who work primarily at one specific
								site to provide building cleaning, food and security services.</li>
							<li>Although the federal government is not bound by provincial legislation, contractors
								bidding on federal government work are subject to the Act and any amendments. Canada, as
								building owner, has an information-handling role under this legislation.</li>
							<li>Departmental contracting authorities are required to observe the intent of the Ontario
								labour legislation, and, in practice, to follow its provisions.</li>
							<li>On November 1995, Ontario Bill 7 received royal assent. It amended Ontario Bill 40 by
								repealing Part XIII.2, &quot;Successor Employers&quot;, of the <abbr

					process, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></p>
				<p>The minimum solicitation period for procurements done under SAs or one-time prequalification lists

					<li>The main purpose of bid evaluation is to determine the best responsive bid, in accordance with
						the evaluation and selection methodology specified in the solicitation document, among the bids
						submitted before the bid closing time on the date specified in the bid solicitation.</li>
					<li>The responsive bid offering the best value to Canada may or may not necessarily be the one with
						the lowest price. In order to accurately determine best value, a logical systematic evaluation
						procedure covering all aspects of the evaluation process must be followed.</li>
					<li>Before starting the actual technical and financial evaluation of bids, it is necessary to ensure
						that all the information required at bid closing is available and ready to be transmitted to the
						evaluators. It is the responsibility of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to
						determine whether the bids received are complete, as specified in the bid solicitation, before
						further detailed evaluation of the bids. This means, for example, verifying:<ol type="i">
							<li>that certifications or securities required at bid closing are included;</li>
							<li>that bids are properly signed;</li>
							<li>that the bidder is properly identified (particularly important in the case of joint
								ventures);</li>
							<li>acceptance of the terms and conditions of the bid solicitation and resulting contract,
								such as bid validity period;</li>
							<li>ability to meet a clearly specified critical delivery schedule;</li>
							<li>whether the bid is conditional (e.g. limitation of liability), or</li>
							<li>that all documents, required by the bid solicitation to determine technical
								responsiveness, have been submitted.</li>
						</ol>Note: It is recommended that the contracting officer creates and uses a check list of all
						requirements, which can be used throughout the evaluation of each bid.</li>
					<li>Evaluation of bids must be in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the bid solicitation.
						They must be checked for responsiveness to the contractual, technical and financial requirements
						of the bid solicitation. Fair, accurate and transparent evaluation of bids is an important
						aspect of procurement process. Generally, financial bids should not be sent to the technical
						evaluators until after completion of the technical evaluation.</li>

						<li>Mandatory certifications, declarations or proof documents may be requested at bid closing.

					<li>To be considered for contract award, a bid must, at closing date meet all mandatory requirements
						stipulated in the bid solicitation. Bidders are responsible to meet the criteria stipulated in
						the bid solicitation as well as request clarification before submitting a bid if they are not
						sure they understand a requirement. The instructions to bidders clearly provide that <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> may request clarification
						from bidders, but it is under no obligation to do so.</li>
					<li>If <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> decides to request
						clarifications or additional supporting data from the bidders, the contracting officer must
						ensure that this process does not give any bidder an advantage over the others. In no event can
						this clarification alter the price quoted or any substantive element of a bid.</li>
					<li>Only clarifications which do not change the substance or price of a bid may be requested and
						accepted. The request for clarifications and response must be in writing. Any response, which
						leads to a substantial change in the bid is considered bid repair and must not be considered in
						the bid evaluation. Pursuant to the <a href="https://citt-tcce.gc.ca/en/home.html"
							rel="external">Canadian International Trade Tribunal</a> (CITT), a clarification is
						acceptable only if it is an explanation of some existing aspect of the bid that does not amount
						to a substantive revision or modification of the bid. Bidders cannot be allowed to repair their
						bid through a clarification process.</li>
					<li>In conducting its evaluation of the bids, Canada may, but has no obligation to correct any error
						in the extended pricing of bids by using unit pricing and any error in quantities in bids to
						reflect the quantities stated in the bid solicitation. In the case of error in the extension of
						prices, the unit price will govern.</li>
					<li>If an unusually low price is identified, the bidder must be given the opportunity to either
						confirm or withdraw its bid in writing. Once confirmed, the supplier must accept the price in
						any resulting contract. The contracting officer must not divulge the difference in price between
						that bid and the next lowest bid. In no event will the bidder be permitted to increase the
						price. In solicitations with bid security, this provision may not apply.</li>
					<li>The contracting officer will specify in the request the number of days the bidders will have to
						comply with any request. Failure to comply with the request may result in the bid being declared
						non-responsive.</li>

						other mandatory evaluation criteria (technical, financial or other) will be declared
						non-responsive.</li>
					<li>For Complexity Levels 2 and 3, the procurement risk assessment may determine that a Formal Peer
						Review of the results of the bid evaluation is required. For Complexity Levels 4 and 5
						inclusive, a review of the results of the bid evaluation is mandatory. For more information on
						the Formal Peer Review, see <a href="#section-5.45.1">5.45.1 Formal Peer Review of
							Evaluation</a>. In all other situations once the bid evaluation is completed, contracting
						officers are encouraged to obtain a review of the results of that evaluation prior to issuing
						the contract.</li>
					<li>In some cases, third parties may be invited to assist in evaluating bids, for example, scholars
						and other experts. When third parties will be involved, bidders must be advised in the bid
						solicitation. In general, third parties participating in the evaluation, or in the bid
						preparation, must sign a non-disclosure agreement and a conflict of interest agreement before
						such participation.</li>
					<li>Bids must be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria established in the bid
						solicitation. Even though the onus is on bidders to submit clear and well-organized bids, bids
						must be reviewed with diligence and thoroughness to ensure that no essential information is
						missed. The evaluators must not use criteria or factors not included in the bid solicitation or
						derive conclusions from information contained in bids that may prove wrong. Whenever possible,
						the same evaluators should evaluate all bids. When evaluating bids, evaluators must consider all
						vital information provided in the bid, and must not base their evaluation on undisclosed
						criteria.</li>
					<li>Documents pertaining to the evaluation of bids must be retained. Evaluators must provide the
						original or a copy of all evaluation notes and communications to the contracting officer for
						filing on the procurement file. All such information is subject to the <a
							href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-1/" rel="external">Access to Information
							Act</a>. For example, evaluators&#39; worksheets must not be destroyed even if the
						information contained in the worksheets is recorded in other evaluation documents. Following a
						relevant Canadian International Trade Tribunal decision, it was found that evaluators&#39;
						worksheets are an integral part of the evaluation process and constitute part of the complete
						record regarding the procurement and part of the written record of all communications
						substantially affecting the procurement within the meaning of the international trade
						agreements. Destroying the evaluators&#39; worksheets is a breach of the international trade
						agreements. Although no similar provision exists in the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA),
						the maintenance of complete documentation is also essential under the <abbr

						procedures. Contracting officers can also refer to the Treasury Board <a

					<li>If identical low bids are received the contract should be awarded on the basis of best value.
						The factors below should be used, subject to directives on national policies and objectives that
						may be issued from time to time. These criteria may be weighted as considered appropriate by the
						contracting officer:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>a bidder with an overall satisfactory performance record is given preference over a
								bidder known to have a less satisfactory performance record;</li>
							<li>a bidder in a position to provide adequate after-sales service, with a good record in
								this regard, will be given preference over a bidder who is less able to provide adequate
								service or who has a poor record;</li>
							<li>when delivery is an important factor, the bidder offering the best delivery date should
								be given preference;</li>
							<li>when there are several items included in the bid and only some items are priced
								identically, the bid offering the greatest dollar value should be given preference; and
							</li>
							<li>when there are several items included in the bid and one or more bidders bid lower on
								one or more of the items, the lowest bidder with the greatest dollar value should be
								given preference both for the items on which it bid equal prices and for the items on
								which it bid lower.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>If there are two (or more) identical bids, and provided that the bid selected would still be
						considered the most advantageous to Canada, preference should be given to the bidder who assumes
						all or part of the exchange rate adjustment risk over a bidder who does not assume any of this
						risk. Furthermore, preference should be given to the bidder who assumes all of the exchange rate
						adjustment risk over a bidder who assumes only part of this risk.</li>
					<li>If none of the above applies, a method of tie breaking that is mutually acceptable to Canada and
						the bidders with identical bids can be used. As an example, a simple coin toss could be agreed
						upon. The mutually agreed solution should involve legal advice.</li>

					<li>When two or more responsive bids are received in response to a competitive bid solicitation and
						if no responsive bid represents fair value, contracting officers should examine the solicitation
						to determine possible causes. Subsequently, the contracting officer may consider negotiating
						with all responsive bidders or cancelling and reissuing the bid solicitation.</li>
					<li>When negotiating with more than one firm, care should be taken that all are treated fairly and
						impartially. The negotiations should not become an auction of the contract, as firms
						progressively improve their bids in the light of information about the position of other firms.
						The confidentiality of each firm&#39;s negotiating position is to be assured.</li>
					<li>The contracting officer must conduct all negotiations. If it is of a technical nature, the
						contracting officer and the client should conduct the negotiations. A negotiation report must be
						placed on the procurement file.</li>
					<li>For procurements subject to the trade agreements contracting officers must conduct negotiations
						in accordance with the conditions of these agreements. For example, see <a

					<li>For procurements not subject to trade agreements,<ol class="double-space" type="i">
							<li>when a bid solicitation was used, negotiations may be entered into:<ol type="A">
									<li>before the completion of bid evaluation, provided that they are held with all

										submitted the only responsive bid. Or, the bidder was selected after evaluating
										more than one responsive bid, but it can be demonstrated that if the
										negotiations had been held with all of the bidders that submitted responsive
										bids, there would have been no change in the bidder selected.</li>
								</ol>The ability to prove that the same bidder will be selected, regardless of whether
								negotiations are conducted with all responsive bidders, presupposes that the requirement
								(for example, technical specifications) will not change during negotiations and,
								therefore, that other bidders given the same opportunity could not submit different or
								better offers;</li>
							<li>when an Invitation to Tender (ITT) was used and there is more than one responsive bid,

						Contracting officers must carefully assess the potential for extended bid evaluation periods and
						indicate in the bid solicitation the modified period for bid acceptance. Contracting officers
						must also carefully monitor events during the bid evaluation period and contract approval
						process in order to award the contract before the bid acceptance period has expired. Expiry of
						bid acceptance periods before contract award should thus become an exceptional circumstance.
					</li>
					<li>If the bid acceptance period has expired, and the contract has not been awarded, the bid

					<li>Any contract awarded to a bidder after the bid expiry date is considered a sole-source contract,

					<li>If the evaluation is incomplete and is unlikely to be completed within a reasonable period of

						solicitation reissued.</li>
					<li>As stated in the standard instructions, Canada may seek an extension of the bid validity period
						from all responsive bidders in writing within a minimum of three (3) days before the end of the
						bid validity period. If all responsive bidders accept the extension, Canada will continue with
						the evaluation of the bids. If all responsive bidders do not accept the extension, Canada will,

					<li>Where a bidder does not agree to the extension and it is clear that this particular bidder has
						no chance of being recommended for award, then it may be appropriate to exercise Canada&#39;s

					International Trade Tribunal (CITT) determinations, Treasury Board decisions, etc. specific to the
					requirement.</p>
				<h4>Estimated Cost and Name of Client</h4>
				<p>State the estimated cost, the Goods and Services Tax or Harmonized Sales Tax included, for the
					requirement. Include any options, set-aside amounts, etc., and state which client department it is
					chargeable to.</p>
				<h4>Anticipated Contract (or Standing offer or supply arrangement) Approval Authority Required</h4>
				<p>Indicate the anticipated contract approval authority. Explain why this would be the approval
					authority, if not evident.</p>
				<h4>Sourcing</h4>
				<p>Identify applicable trade agreements (<abbr title="exempli gratia">e.g.</abbr> <cite>Canada-European
						Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement</cite>, <cite>World Trade Organization
						Agreement on Government Procurement</cite>, <cite>Canadian Free Trade Agreement</cite>, etc.),
					Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements, and any significant policies governing sourcing decisions

					Services.</p>
				<h4>Evaluation and Contractor Selection Methodology</h4>
				<p>Identify the evaluation criteria and the selection method to be used with any bid solicitation,
					including pricing basis, point rating or mandatory/desirable criteria for the technical evaluation.
				</p>
				<h4>Anticipated Basis of Payment</h4>
				<p>Provide an indication of the anticipated basis of payment to be used in the contract, (e.g. firm
					price, fixed time rates, ceiling price, limitation of expenditure, etc.)</p>
				<p>Use this section to substantiate the use of advance payments, and to indicate when financial security
					(e.g. surety bond, irrevocable standby letter of credit) will be required from the
					supplier/contractor. Address contract audit provisions.</p>
				<h4>Milestones</h4>
				<p>Give target dates for important milestones (for example, bid solicitation, contract award, delivery
					schedule) in the form of &quot;early&quot; May or &quot;mid&quot; August or &quot;late&quot;
					October, rather than specific dates.</p>
				<h4>Additional Comments</h4>
				<p>Include any information that should be brought to the approval authority&#39;s attention, e.g.
					limitation of contractor&#39;s liability, fairness monitor, industrial security requirements,
					intellectual property, business line consultations, green procurement.</p>
				<h4>Contracting Officer</h4>
				<p>State the name, sector/region, division and telephone number of the authority responsible for the
					project.</p>

						<li>The limits shown in the Delegation of Authorities Tables are maximums as defined by the
							application of both a Complexity Assessment and a Procurement Risk Assessment. The authority
							required for contract entry or amendments will be determined on a case-by-case basis through
							the application of a procurement risk assessment appropriate for the level of complexity.
							This assessment will identify the specific risks of a procurement or proposed amendment, and
							the appropriate level of approval required for contract entry or issuing a contract
							amendment.</li>
						<li>For Complexity Levels 4 and 5 inclusive, with the exception of administrative amendments,
							the approval authority for contract entry and non-administrative amendments is set at
							Assistant Deputy Minister, Acquisitions Branch, regardless of the competitiveness of the
							requirement.</li>
						<li>The relevant limits for individual officers, which may be lower than the maximums identified
							in the Delegation of Authority Tables, are contingent upon Acquisitions Branch policies and
							procedures. Contracting officers must ensure that any authorities they exercise are in
							accordance with their approved delegation form.</li>
						<li>For the purposes of contract approval authorities, an Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN)
							is classified under the &quot;electronic bidding&quot; category. The electronic bidding
							approval levels apply whenever an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>
							has been posted and no valid Statement of Capabilities was submitted.</li>
						<li>Refer to <a href="#annex-6.4.5">Annex 6.4.5 Table of Equivalent Positions</a> for position
							titles under each level.</li>
						<li>Any incumbent, under any level, who holds a valid delegation of approval authority for
							contract entry may sign a contractual document for the same commodities for which the
							incumbent has delegation of authority, regardless of dollar value. For example, if the
							incumbent holds a valid delegation of approval authority for contract entry for goods and
							military repair and overhaul, then the incumbent has signing authority for goods and
							military repair and overhaul.</li>
						<li>By default, the delegation limits of individual officers are a percentage of the
							departmental authority:<br>
							<ol start="1" type="i">
								<li>Level 1 and 2 positions have 100% of the departmental authority;</li>
								<li>Level 3 positions have 50% of the departmental authority; and</li>
								<li>Level 4 positions have 5% of the departmental authority.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>For information on contract entry approval authorities for contracts requiring ratification,
							refer to section <a href="#section-6.30.5">6.30.5 Ratifications within Department
								Authorities</a>.</li>
						<li>If the total cost of the procurement for approval purposes exceeds the limits set out in
							<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s Delegation of
							Authority Instrument, Treasury Board approval is required.</li>

									the amendment that reduces the value of the contract (when the amendment is
									administrative in nature).</li>
								<li>Situation: The client reduces the quantity required but the supplier/contractor
									wants to increase the price because of the reduced quantity. Renegotiation is
									necessary.<br>Approval Level: The approval level for the contract amendment is that
									required for the revised unit price multiplied by the new quantity. Aggregate
									amendment approval authorities apply.</li>
								<li>Situation: The client wishes to disencumber funds allocated to a repair and overhaul
									contract in the last quarter of the fiscal year, because no more work arising will
									be forthcoming during that period.<br>Approval Level: The contracting authority,
									designated as such in the contract, may approve an amendment to reduce the value of
									the contract (considered an administrative amendment).</li>
								<li>Situation: The client requires a work package to be removed from a research and
									development contract. There is no clear relationship between the reduced cost and
									the reduced work package.<br>Approval Level: The amendment will be approved at a
									level equal to the value of the proposed cost reduction. Aggregate amendment
									approval authorities apply. Nil value amendment is not appropriate as there is no
									link between the value of the work package and the reduction.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Substitute Item (or work package)<br>If a client requests the contracting authority to amend
							a contract by deleting an item (or work package) and substituting a different item (or work
							package), the value of the substitute item (or work package) will determine the contract
							amendment approval level. A Risk Assessment for Amendments must be performed to determine
							the appropriate approval authority required to add the substitute item (or work package).
						</li>
						<li>Additional Risks<br>Contract amendments that propose changes to either the basis of payment,
							the method of payment or the contract conditions, so that additional risk or liability is
							transferred to Canada, must be authorized in accordance with the Procurement Risk Assessment
							for Amendments for that contract only if corresponding compensatory benefits accrue to
							Canada. In the absence of corresponding benefits, such changes would constitute extra
							payments for which only <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> has approval
							authority.<br>The following are examples of changes that would constitute additional risk to
							Canada:<ol type="a">
								<li>liberalizing the progress payments;</li>
								<li>eliminating the requirement for a performance bond;</li>
								<li>slippage, by the contractor, of firm delivery dates.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Advance Approval for Amount Set Aside<ol class="double-space" type="a">
								<li>If the original authority to enter into a contract also included advance approval
									for an amount to be set aside for unscheduled work, design changes or work arising,
									then any amount set aside used must be approved by the appropriate non-competitive
									contract entry approval authority, not to exceed the Director level. The Risk
									Assessment for Amendments will determine the appropriate approval authority. When
									completing the &quot;Value&quot; question of the <abbr
										title="Risk Assessment for Amendments">RAA</abbr>, contracting officers are to
									select &quot;set aside amount&quot;.</li>
								<li>If an amendment to use the remainder of the amount set aside for a specific purpose
									exceeds the amount set aside, the approval authority for the excess amount will
									revert back to the appropriate aggregate amendment approval authority in accordance
									with <a href="#annex-6.4.2">Annex 6.4.2: Contracting Limits including Exceptional
										Authorities</a>. Aggregate amendment values of set asides, previously approved,
									are separate from the aggregate amendment values of either options or normal
									amendments. If required, set-asides can be exercised to the maximum value in one
									amendment.</li>
								<li>If a condition of the original approval requires other levels of approval for
									encumbering amounts set aside, the levels established in the original contract
									approval will take precedence.</li>
								<li>The amount of the set aside should be based on sound front-end planning and
									preparation. The better the planning and preparation the better the ability to
									predict additional quantities or unforeseen work arising, and the more accurate the
									assigned dollars values. A procurement plan that is thoroughly justified as to the
									purpose of each planned expenditure, is more likely to be approved.</li>
								<li>Some examples of the vehicles used to utilize the amount of the set-aside are
									Contract amendment, work authorization form, form DND 626 Requisition on a Contract,
									or a Pre-Approved Amount for Anticipated Amendments (PAAA).</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Advance Approval for Options<ol class="double-space" type="a">
								<li>Once approval has been obtained to exercise an option, the contract amendment to
									exercise the option requires only the signature of an incumbent, under any level,
									who holds a valid delegation of approval authority for contract entry for the same
									categories for which the incumbent has delegation of authority. For example, if an
									incumbent holds delegation of authority for contract entry for goods and military
									repair and overhaul, then that incumbent would have signing authority for goods and
									military repair and overhaul. Aggregate values of options, previously approved, are
									separate from the aggregate amendment values of either set-asides or normal
									amendments. If required, options can be exercised to the maximum value in one
									amendment.</li>
								<li>Funds and approval received for an option can only be used for the specific purpose
									stated in the approval document. For example, if approval was obtained for a 1 year
									services contract valued at $200,000, with an option year also valued at $200,000,
									the contracting officer cannot use the approval and funding related to the option
									year to cover an increase in the services required during the first year.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Contract Code for Pre-approved Amendments<ol class="double-space" type="a">
								<li>Document Type number 22, Contract Code for Pre-approved Amendments is available in
									SELECT, and is used to identify all pre-approved amendments.</li>
								<li>These include, but are not limited to:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
										<li>amendments issued to exercise an option for additional quantities or years
											that formed part of the original bid solicitation and approved as part of
											the original contract approval submission; and,</li>
										<li>amendments which use amounts set-aside for anticipated, but not yet clearly
											defined, changes (e.g., unscheduled work, design changes, work arising),
											which were approved as part of the original contract approval submission.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>Amendments that do not fit within the description of the original approval or go
									beyond the scope or value of the approval will be coded as &quot;Normal
									Amendments&quot; and must be approved at the appropriate level as determined by the
									Minister&#39;s delegation of amendment authorities.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Rates (or prices-to-be-negotiated)/Interim Rates (or prices)<br>If the basis of payment in a
							contract includes interim rates (or prices) and it is proposed to amend the contract to
							provide for firm rates (or prices) in lieu, then the amendment approval authority level will
							be as follows (unless otherwise instructed by the contract approval authority):<ol
								class="double-space" type="a">
								<li>Contracting authority, only if the firm rates (or prices) are equal to or less than
									the interim rates (or prices); or</li>
								<li>For Level 1, 2 and 3 procurements, a Procurement Risk Assessment for Amendments is
									required to determine the appropriate approval authority; or</li>
								<li>Director General, if the contract was approved by the Assistant Deputy Minister, the
									Minister or <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr>.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Combining Several Types of Contract Changes in One Amendment<br>When a contract amendment is
							raised to incorporate several types of changes enumerated above (i.e., firming up
							price-to-be-negotiated items, using a portion of an amount set aside, addition of
							items/quantities, etc.), the highest approval level must apply for any one type of these
							changes or combinations being incorporated into the contract by that amendment.</li>
						<li>Amendments to Contracts with Former Public Servants<br>Treasury Board (TB) must approve all
							amendments to service contracts with former public servants in receipt of a pension pursuant
							to the <cite>Public Service Superannuation Act</cite> when these amendments exceed the
							limits specified in section 1.1.1 of <a href="#annex-6.4.1">Annex 6.4.1: Approval
								Authorities and Additional Signing Authorities in Support of Clients&#39; Programs Only
								- Other than for Canadian Commercial Corporation</a>.</li>
						<li>Interpretation of Aggregate Amendment Value<ol class="double-space" type="a">
								<li>All amendment approval authorities (for amendments not pre-approved) must be
									determined on the basis of the aggregate amendment value.</li>
								<li>Aggregate amendment value means the sum total of the amendments to a contract,
									including positive and negative amendments. It applies only to amendments requiring
									<abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> approval. For internal purposes and to ensure
									adequate control measures are in place, the aggregate amount for amendments not
									pre-approved will be calculated using only positive amendments.</li>
								<li>As a general principle, once an approval level has been reached, it can never be
									lowered. As an example, once the manager level for approval has been reached for
									Complexity Level 1 procurements, then every subsequent positive amendment reverts to
									the manager regardless of dollar value.</li>
								<li>Nil value amendments where no further risk or liability accrued to Canada are
									administrative in nature and can be approved and signed by the Contracting
									Authority. For nil value amendments where further risk or liability will be
									Canada&#39;s responsibility, the completion of a Risk Assessment for Amendments is
									required to determine the appropriate approval authority.</li>
								<li>Extending the period of a contract with a specific end date (i.e. a contract, task
									authorization contract, standing offer or supply arrangement, etc.) cannot be
									treated as administrative in nature. Adding additional time to the contract
									represents additional liability for Canada regardless of whether or not additional
									funding is required. For example, if a contract has been awarded for a two (2) year
									period ending March 31st, in the amount of $10M and there is $4M left over on
									April 1st, that $4M cannot be used for an extension of the contract without
									obtaining the appropriate approval, even though the original approval to contract
									was for $10M.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Treasury Board Approval for Amendments<br><abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> must seek Treasury
							Board (TB) approval to amend a contract or contractual arrangement if the total value,
							including all applicable taxes and fees, exceeds the limits identified in Appendix A:
							Contracting Approvals of the <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> <a
								href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32692"
								rel="external"><cite>Directive on the Management of Procurement</cite></a>.</li>
						<li>Extension of the time element of contracts or contractual arrangements approved by Treasury
							Board<ol class="double-space" type="a">
								<li>As per <a
										href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/policy-notice/2000-3.html"
										rel="external"><cite><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>
											Contracting Policy Notice 2000-3</cite></a>, the time element of <abbr
										title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> approved contracts/contractual arrangements may
									be extended without further Treasury Board (TB) approval only when all of the
									following conditions are met:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
										<li>The extension’s maximum duration is the lesser of two years or 50 percent of
											the duration of the contract/contractual arrangement (including pre-approved
											amendments);</li>
										<li>There is no financial implication to an end date amendment or the financial
											impact is within the contracting limits specified in the <abbr
												title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> <a
												href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32692"
												rel="external"><cite>Directive on the Management of
													Procurement</cite></a>;</li>
										<li>The end date included in the original <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr>
											submission was not considered a critical part of the <abbr
												title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> approval; and</li>
										<li>The contract/contractual arrangement period in the original <abbr
												title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> submission was indicated to be
											approximate or non-specific.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>‘No financial implication’ does not mean that there can be no spending in the
									extension period. It means the spending during the time extension must remain within
									scope and value of the <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> approved
									contract/contractual arrangement.</li>
								<li>Considering that the end date is contingent on various factors, delivery/time frame
									in the <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> submission is provided as an estimate
									using project planning tools, assumptions and a best case scenario. For instance,
									the precise time frame may vary based on factors such as the actual start date,
									uncontrollable delays that impacted the delivery/time frame, nature and complexity
									of the work itself or the work environment. Therefore, this date may not have been a
									critical piece of the requirement or <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr>
									submission and will need to be determined on a case by case basis and explained.
								</li>
								<li>Contracting officers must carefully assess the circumstances and reasons that
									warrant extending the time element of a <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr>
									approved contract/contractual arrangement. This assessment must be documented on
									file and should address the following:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
										<li>Is there supporting justification for the decision to proceed with the
											contract/contractual arrangement extension?</li>
										<li>How does the extension meet all of the above identified <abbr
												title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> conditions for amending the
											contract/contractual arrangement without returning to <abbr
												title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> for approval?</li>
										<li>The scope of the contract/contractual arrangement:<ol class="double-space"
												type="A">
												<li>Are contractual expenditures still within the scope of the <abbr
														title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> approval? Are the projected
													expenditures in the proposed extension reasonable or supported by
													historical spend on the contract/contractual arrangement?</li>
												<li>Are the deliverables different?</li>
												<li>Are the terms and conditions being compromised?</li>
												<li>Is the contract/contractual arrangement substantively changing from
													how it was initially presented, and would <abbr
														title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Ministers have an interest?
												</li>
												<li>Was the delivery/time frame a key element of the <abbr
														title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> approval?</li>
												<li>In the case of services contracts/contractual arrangements, what
													were industry expectations?</li>
												<li>When was the period of service expected to be up for renewal and for
													tender?</li>
												<li>Are there new suppliers in the market that would question the
													fairness of the extension?</li>
											</ol>
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>If the contractor is responsible for the work delay but the extension can be
									justified (such as insufficient time to recompete or other exceptional
									circumstances), what Vendor Performance Corrective Measures have been taken against
									the contractor to mitigate the procurement risk for the remainder of the
									contract/contractual arrangement?</li>
								<li>Adding additional time to a contract/contractual arrangement (outside of
									pre-approved amendments for pre-approved option years) represents additional
									liability for Canada and therefore, must not be treated as an administrative
									amendment. Contracting officers must obtain the appropriate internal approval for
									the contract/contractual arrangement extension amendment. The approval authority for
									the time extension amendment will depend on the complexity and risk levels as
									follows:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
										<li>For Complexity Levels 1, 2 and 3 - the Risk Assessment for Amendments (RAA)
											must be used to determine the approval authority.</li>
										<li>For Complexity Levels 4 and 5, the approval authority is the Acquisitions
											Program(AP) Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) - Defence and Marine Procurement
											Branch or Procurement Branch.</li>

						<li><strong>Standing Offers and Supply Arrangements</strong>: In the past, departments and

				<ol start="1" type="a">
					<li>Debriefing<ol start="1" type="i">
							<li>The purpose of a debriefing is to explain to unsuccessful bidders/offerors/suppliers why
								their bid/offer/arrangement was not accepted, allowing them to improve their future
								documents. A debriefing demonstrates the fairness, openness, and transparency of the
								federal government contracting process. Also, contracting officers can improve future
								solicitations by using the comments and suggestions provided by
								bidders/offerors/suppliers.</li>
							<li>Every solicitation must include a provision stating that bidders/offerors/suppliers may
								request a debriefing about the results of the solicitation. The departmental standard
								procurement templates include a provision to this effect.</li>
							<li>Following the award of a contract or issuance of a standing offer (SO)/supply
								arrangement (SA), a debriefing will be provided upon request. A written debriefing is
								usually done in the form of a regret letter that is sent out to each unsuccessful
								bidder/offeror/supplier. See samples of regret letters in <a href="#annex-7.1">Annex 7.1
									Samples of Regret Letters</a>.</li>
							<li>In the case of a complex procurement, when a solicitation is conducted in phases, the

								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Feedback Session<ol start="1" type="i">
							<li>A feedback session is a form of debriefing. A feedback session will be provided, upon
								request, when a solicitation is to be cancelled and reissued. The purpose of a feedback
								session is to provide the bidder/offeror/supplier with information specific to their
								bid/offer/arrangement. As an example, a feedback session will provide the
								bidder/offeror/supplier with information on which mandatory criteria they passed or
								failed or their overall technical score or their score for each technical criterion.
								This information will allow the bidder/offeror/supplier to understand why their
								bid/offer/arrangement failed to meet the requirements. No information regarding other
								bids/offers/arrangements or the solicitation to be reissued must be divulged.</li>
							<li>In order to ensure the fairness, openness, and transparency of the solicitation process,
								all bidders/offerors/suppliers must have access to the same information on the
								solicitation to be reissued. Therefore, all information provided in a feedback session
								must be documented by the Contracting Authority. The information communicated during the
								feedback session, where pertinent, will be provided in a generic form in the
								solicitation to be reissued to maintain fairness to all potential
								bidders/offerors/suppliers. One or both of the following measures will be taken to
								provide bidders/offerors/suppliers with this information:<ol start="1" type="A">
									<li>The particular area of concern will be highlighted more prominently with
										additional instructions to bidders/offerors/suppliers in the solicitation to be
										reissued (for example, by adding text to inform or focus attention).</li>

										solicitation;</li>
									<li>the sensitivity of the procurement; and</li>

				<ol class="double-space" type="a">
					<li>Contract management is the process of systematically and efficiently managing contract
						development, implementation, and administration for maximizing financial and operational
						performance and managing inherent risk. Contract management encompasses the life cycle of a
						contract and involves many stakeholders including, but not limited to the contracting officer,
						the client department and the supplier.</li>
					<li>Contract administration is an important part of contract management, which includes those
						activities performed after a contract award, to ensure files are properly maintained and that
						the contractor meets the requirements of the contract.</li>
					<li>Contract management is an essential element of the procurement process that protects the
						interests of Canada while ensuring that suppliers are being treated fairly. Contract management
						can be divided into four distinct phases:<ol type="i">
							<li>pre-contractual (planning);</li>
							<li>contracting (bidding and awarding of contract);</li>
							<li>contract administration (after the contract is awarded);</li>
							<li>post-contractual (close out, warranty and audit).</li>
						</ol>The pre-contractual phase is addressed in the contents of <a href="#section-2">Chapter 2 -
							Defining the Requirement and Requisition Receipt</a> and <a href="#section-3">Chapter 3 -
							Procurement Strategy</a>. The importance of early involvement by contracting officers during
						the pre-contractual phase cannot be overstated, as this sets the tone for the balance of the
						contract life cycle activities.</li>
					<li>Planning of the details of how the contract will be managed should start during the formulation
						of the requirement itself, which will set the standards of what the contractor must do, how
						performance will be monitored and what standards will be used. These details, together with
						other procedures related to how the contract will be managed, should be included in the bid
						solicitation, to allow bidders to determine what is required of them, to plan the activities
						needed and to reflect the costs in their bids.</li>
					<li>The contracting phase is addressed in <a href="#section-4">Chapter 4 - Solicitation Process</a>
						through <a href="#section-7">Chapter 7 - Award of Contracts and Issuance of Standing Offers and
							Supply Arrangements</a>. Responsibility for the elements of the contracting phase fall
						generally to the contracting officer, though client departments have lead responsibility for
						some elements (see <a href="#annex-1.2">Annex: Specific Division of Responsibilities
							Agreements</a>).</li>
					<li>In general, the level of effort required for contract management will vary depending on the
						value and complexity of the procurement. Low dollar value or simple contracts may require only
						minimum management, while more complex contracts will require continuous monitoring by both the
						client and the contracting officer. A dedicated team of clients and contracting officers may be
						assigned to large projects, where roles and responsibilities are defined in more detail.</li>

						<h3><a id="section-8.70.5">8.70.5 Amending contracts</a></h3>
						<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2021-05-20</time>)</p>
					</header>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Contract amendments are used to formally delete, modify, or introduce new conditions to the
							original contract. The need for an amendment may arise from continuing negotiations or to
							deal with an unforeseen circumstance. When amending a contract, Canada&#39;s best interest
							should be considered. Amendments are subject to agreement by both parties to the contract.
							Where the vendor is subject to a relevant Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy
							(VPCMP), the length of the contract cannot be extended either by an amendment or through the
							exercise of an option unless:<ol type="i">
								<li>there is insufficient time to recompete; or</li>
								<li>there are other exceptional circumstances.</li>
							</ol>These situations require <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> approval in
							accordance with <a href="#section-8.180.25">8.180.25 Exceptions</a>.</li>
						<li>Contracting officers must carefully analyze the need for an amendment versus the need to
							issue a new contract and every effort should be made to avoid:<ol type="i">
								<li>inadequate initial funding, resulting in an amendment to increase the contract
									value;</li>
								<li>inadequate pre-planning, resulting in an amendment to the design, specifications or
									quantity involved; and</li>
								<li>improper administrative procedures, necessitating an amendment to the specifications
									and delivery or other requirement in order to protect the contractor or government
									agency involved.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>In addition to the above regarding contract amendment in general, for the purpose of the
							Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy (VPCMP), a conditional amendment is a specific
							type of contract amendment. It is used for operational reasons in lieu of a full or partial
							termination for default when there is a performance issue for which the vendor is primarily
							responsible. When a contracting officer is ready to terminate or partially terminate for
							default, a conditional amendment is available as an alternative to immediate termination. If
							the vendor refuses the conditional amendment, then the contract must be terminated for
							default and no normal amendment can be issued. (See <a href="#section-8.180.10">8.180.10
								Definitions</a> for more information on conditional amendments and <a
								href="#section-8.180.15.1">8.180.15.1</a>(c) for the paragraph to be inserted in a
							conditional amendment. See also <a href="#section-8.135.15">8.135.15 Termination for
								Default</a> and <a href="#annex-8.4">Annex 8.4 Termination for Default</a>.) As with
							terminations for default, conditional amendments will trigger a <abbr
								title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> Assessment process
							under the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr>. (See <a
								href="#section-8.180">8.180 Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy</a>.)</li>
						<li>Integrity Provisions<ol type="i">
								<li>For each amendment to a contract where the Integrity Provisions have been amended,
									except for administrative amendments and call-ups against standing offers,
									contracting officers must follow the verification process specified in section <a
										href="#section-5.16">5.16 Integrity Compliance</a>. For further details on the
									verification process, see sections 5.16 Integrity Compliance and <a
										href="#section-8.70.2">8.70.2 Compliance with the Integrity Provisions</a>.</li>
								<li>When a significant contract amendment is to be done for an existing contract which
									does not contain the most recent Integrity Provisions (<abbr
										title="For example">e.g.</abbr> increase to the contract value, to exercise an
									option, to extend the contract period, to modify the requirement, or the assignment
									of a contract), contracting officers must propose to add or revise the Integrity
									Provisions of the contract. Contracting officers may use the Template Letter for
									Addition of Provisions to an Existing Contract (see <a href="#annex-8.13">8.13.
										Annex: Letter Templates for Integrity</a>).</li>
								<li>Where the contractor refuses to make changes to the Integrity Provision or provide
									the certification as requested in the Template Letter for Addition of Provisions to
									an Existing Contract, best efforts should be made to ensure that the supplier has a
									clear understanding of the terms of the new Integrity Provisions. This may include
									having a manager contact the contractor directly. Where the contractor still refuses
									to update the Integrity Provisions, the refusal should not prevent the continuation
									of business operations and the contract amendment may proceed. For assistance,
									contact the Acquisitions Program Integrity Secretariat (APIS), by e-mail at <a
										href="mailto:TPSGC.DGAIntegrite-ABIntegrity.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca"
										rel="external">TPSGC.DGAIntegrite-ABIntegrity.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a>.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The amendment format will follow the form of the original contract. The amendment should
							identify, by using complete clauses, any changes, additions, conditions or deletions.</li>
						<li>To reduce administrative costs, contracting officers and client departments should combine
							as many individual changes as possible into each amendment. For example, multiple design
							changes or deviations can be amended together.</li>
						<li>Amendments should receive the same distribution as the original contract.</li>

					<li>When the contract contains security requirements, the contracting officer, with the assistance
						of the Contract Security Program (CSP), must ensure that the assignee meets all security
						requirements specified in the contract.</li>
					<li>In order to comply with the Integrity Provisions, the proposed assignee needs to provide a
						signed certification (see <a href="#annex-8.13">Annex 8.13 Letter Templates for Integrity</a>)
						and, if applicable, a list of names of directors, or, for privately owned corporations, the
						names of the owners of the corporation. The contracting officer must then proceed to verify
						compliance to the Integrity Provisions as further detailed in section <a
							href="#section-5.16">5.16 Integrity Compliance</a>.</li>
					<li>If the assignee, or its affiliates, is found to be ineligible or suspended under the <a
							href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/politique-policy-eng.html"

						supplier is ineligible or suspended.</li>
					<li>All proposed assignments supported by a contracting officer must be referred to a cost analyst
						for review.</li>
					<li>Legal Services is available to provide advice about whether or not an assignment of contract is
						an available option under the terms and conditions of the contract and whether one is necessary
						(i.e. in some situations, such as a change in the name of the contractor rather than a change in
						the entity, it is possible simply to revise the name in the contract). Legal Services can also
						provide a template Consent to Assignment.</li>
					<li>When a contractor assigns a contract, the responsibility for all or part of the performance is
						transferred to a third party. However, the assignment of a contract must not relieve the
						original contractor of any obligations under the contract or impose any additional liability on
						Canada, in relation to the assignee.</li>
					<li>In order to protect Canada&#39;s interest, the transfer of the liabilities and rights of the
						contract from the original contractor under the original contract to the assignee, will be done
						so that the original contractor is ultimately liable for the performance of the contract. An
						acceptable manner of protecting Canada&#39;s interest is to obtain the original contractor&#39;s
						guarantee of performance in the event that the assignee fails to perform.</li>
					<li>The contracting officer will forward the assignment agreement to the appropriate <abbr
							title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> signing authority, with the
						reasons for the assignment, the number and value of contracts involved, and the financial
						condition of the assignee.</li>
					<li>In the case of Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) contracts, a copy of the approved

						<li>The purpose of the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy (VPCMP) is to assist the

							during that period. Otherwise, the provisions of the applicable previous version remain in
							effect for transactions issued prior to November 4, 2010.</li>
						<li>Vendor performance issues are an important component of procurement risk management. As

					<p>For the purpose of the generic process in this policy, the following terms or expressions have
						the following meaning:</p>
					<ol class="double-space" type="a">
						<li><strong><dfn>Conditional amendment:</dfn> </strong>refers to an amendment to a contract
							being made for operational reasons in lieu of a termination for default or a partial
							termination for default because of poor performance. This type of amendment may only be
							considered when the contracting officer is ready to terminate (full or partial) for default.
							It is an alternative to immediate termination for default. If not accepted by the vendor,
							the termination for default will be issued.</li>
						<li><strong><dfn>Poor performance</dfn></strong>: means anything less than full performance of a
							contract by a vendor that results in either a termination for default or a conditional
							amendment. In both situations the vendor is primarily responsible for the poor performance.
							This definition extends to all aspects of performance that the contracting officer and the
							client want to consider and specify for evaluating the vendor&#39;s performance during the
							contract. (Terminations for default also include partial terminations for default.)</li>
						<li><strong><dfn>Vendor Performance Corrective Measure</dfn> </strong>(VPCM): is a condition or
							limitation placed on a vendor&#39;s ability to contract with Public Works and Government
							Services Canada (PWGSC) in the future on the basis of <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>&#39;s assessment of the
							vendor’s past performance. The <abbr
								title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> affects the vendor’s
							eligibility for consideration for award of contracts and issuance of contract amendments.
						</li>
						<li><strong><dfn>Expiry date of the standing offer</dfn></strong>: means the date upon which the
							standing offer has ended or the date the standing offer is permanently set-aside, whichever
							occurs first.</li>
						<li><strong><dfn>Vendor Information Management System</dfn></strong> (<abbr
								title="Vendor Information Management">VIM</abbr>):  is a database that stores vendor

								are terminated for the convenience of the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>
								government. For terminations involving <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>/<abbr
									title="Canadian Commercial Corporation">CCC</abbr> contracts, the Executive
								Director, Strategic Policy Development and Integration Directorate (SPDID), Strategic
								Policy Sector (SPS), will ensure compliance with the certification and termination
								settlement functions that are required to conform with the <abbr
									title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Department of Defense and Department of National
								Defence Letter of Agreement (see <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Defense Federal

								also be responsive to requests by the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> government
								for arranging for audits of U.S. government contracts or subcontracts placed directly
								with Canadian-based suppliers that are terminated for convenience.</li>
							<li>The contracting officer and the termination claims officer (see <a
									href="#section-8.135.10">8.135.10 Involvement of the termination claims officer</a>)
								are responsible for the following termination activities:<ul class="no-markers">
									<li>The contracting officer:<ul>
											<li>issues Stop Work Order and Notices of Termination; and</li>
											<li>administrates the non-terminated portion of the contract.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<ul class="no-markers">
									<li>The termination claims officer:<ul>
											<li>assesses the contractor&#39;s request for any upward adjustment of the
												contract price for the non-terminated portion of the contract;</li>
											<li>requests claim from contractor and forwards claim forms;</li>
											<li>ensures acceptability of claim by assisting contractor with preparation;
											</li>
											<li>determines, defines and arranges audit, as required;</li>
											<li>arranges for inventory verification and screening by client;</li>
											<li>negotiates final settlement with contractor;</li>
											<li>prepares Settlement and Release document;</li>

											<li>submits invoice through client department; and</li>
											<li>distributes Settlement and Release document.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Occasionally, the client will require a contract status report before making a decision
								to cancel the contract. In this event, the client will inform Public Works and
								Government Services Canada (PWGSC) of its intention to reduce or cancel a contract by
								issuing a &quot;Notice of Intent to Cancel&quot; either by telephone or in writing. The
								client will usually request all or part of the following contract status information
								before making a final decision to terminate:<ol type="i">
									<li>quantity of stores produced against the contract;</li>
									<li>quantity of stores in production;</li>
									<li>value of raw materials and/or components acquired by the contractor to carry out
										the specific contract;</li>
									<li>the position with respect to tooling and capital equipment, especially where the
										contractor had to tool-up to carry out the contract;</li>
									<li>status of subcontracts;</li>
									<li>the most economical point at which to effect termination; and</li>
									<li>the approximate amount of termination claims, if known.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>The contracting officer must immediately request the information from the contractor and
								closely follow up to ensure that it is received as soon as reasonably possible. When the
								information is received, the contracting officer will forward it, together with any
								recommendations, to the client. Normally, the client&#39;s first request will be to
								cancel all or a portion of a contract, in which case the contracting officer should
								immediately issue a Stop Work Order. A Stop Work Order is a safeguard to ensure a halt
								in the work and remove the possibility of further expense being generated by the
								contractor. To terminate the contract, a Stop Work Order must be followed by the
								issuance of a Notice of Termination for Convenience.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Stop Work Order – Notice of Termination<br>On receiving the client&#39;s initial written
						instructions to cancel all or part of a contract for the convenience of Canada (see <a
							href="#section-8.135.5">8.135.5 Termination for Convenience of Canada</a>), the contracting
						officer should immediately issue a Stop Work Order to advise the contractor to &quot;stop
						work&quot; (see the Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions [SACC] Manual clauses <a

						cannot be issued until the formal requisition amendment is received, and a legal opinion has
						been sought. The contracting officer should also contact and provide the termination claims
						officer with a copy of the Stop Work Order and the Notice of Termination.</li>
					<li>No Claim is Involved<br>When a contractor advises the contracting officer that a claim will not
						be submitted following the receipt of a Notice of Termination, the contracting officer must
						eliminate the funding for the terminated items. Since no claim is made, the termination claims
						officer is not involved in this process.</li>
					<li>Client&#39;s Decision<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>It is the client&#39;s responsibility to decide at what stage a full or partial
								termination should take place. Formal amendments to the requisition, confirming the
								decision to terminate, must be provided as quickly as possible.</li>
							<li>The contracting officer must not issue a Notice of Termination for Convenience until an
								amendment to the client&#39;s requisition has been received.</li>
							<li>The contracting officer should ensure that sufficient funds remain in the amended
								requisition to cover the contract value.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Notice of Termination<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>When the requisition amendment is received, the contracting officer will prepare the
								Notice of Termination or Partial Termination by using the clauses provided in <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/J">subsection
									5-J</a>, of the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual, and on
								advice from Legal Services will send the Notice of Termination to the contractor.</li>
							<li>After the Notice of Termination or Partial Termination is issued, the contracting
								officer must immediately forward a copy of the Notice of Termination to the termination
								claims officer.<br>In order to avoid further costs to Canada and hardship to the
								contractor, a Notice of Termination must be issued as quickly as possible to finalize
								the implications of a Stop Work Order.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Adjustment of Funds<br>The funds in the contract must not be adjusted when the Notice of
						Termination is issued. The contract funds will be adjusted on the Settlement and Release
						document.</li>
					<li>Adjustment to the Price of the Non-terminated Portion of the Contract<br>Whenever a contractor
						requests an upward adjustment to the cost or unit price of the non-terminated portion of a
						contract, the resulting claim for adjustment should be referred to the termination claims
						officer for review, before reaching any agreement with the contractor, concerning such upward
						cost or price adjustment.</li>
					<li>Termination File<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>For non-complex, fully terminated contracts, the contracting officer should transfer the
								complete procurement file to the termination claims officer, if a claim is involved.
							</li>
							<li>For complex procurements or partial terminations, where the non-terminated portion of
								the contract is still active, the contracting officer will forward an electronic copy of
								each of the following documents to the termination claims officer as applicable: the
								contract, all amendments, specifications, pricing details, pertinent correspondence and
								any other information relevant to the termination.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Informing the Contractor<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>If a claim is involved, the termination claims officer will forward the termination

							<li>The accompanying letter to the contractor should contain the following
								instructions:<br>&quot;In the event subcontractors are involved with this termination,
								please advise of the number of subcontractors who will require termination claim forms
								and their contact information. Please arrange to complete all sections of the claim in
								as much detail as possible. After signature by your executive authority, return the

							<li>After the termination claim forms are forwarded, the termination claims officer will
								contact the contractor to ensure that the forms have been received and that the
								necessary action is being taken on the contractor&#39;s part to submit a claim. If the
								contractor has any questions concerning the presentation of the claim, or the details of
								the termination settlement procedures, the contractor should contact the termination
								claims officer directly. When the contractor has completed the forms, the signed
								original is returned to the termination claims officer who will then become responsible
								for the resolution of the claim.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Audit of Claims<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>Upon receipt of a claim, the termination claims officer will determine the need for an
								audit. If the termination claims officer concludes that an audit is required, the
								termination claims officer will prepare the terms of reference for the audit and arrange
								for its completion.</li>
							<li>When an audit is performed, the termination claims officer reviews the cost factors
								reported by the auditor, and reconciles the contractor&#39;s claim with the

									<li>Arranging for the verification and shipment of all, or any part, of the
										inventories to a recipient designated by the client. The costs associated with

								Directorate that the inventories are reasonable in relation to the requirements of the
								terminated portion of the relevant contract; that their use is not required for other

							<li>Any proceeds realized from the sale of the surplus inventory are credited (less the

						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Settlement Offer, Close-out and Dispute Resolution<ol class="double-space" type="a">
							<li>The termination claims officer is responsible for reviewing the audit report, if one was
								completed, and negotiating a settlement offer with the Contractor. This offer informs
								the contractor of the amount of the settlement the termination claims officer is
								prepared to recommend to the Executive Director, Strategic Policy Development and
								Integration Directorate (SPDID) for approval.</li>
							<li>Once the contractor accepts the proposed settlement offer, the termination claims
								officer will prepare the Settlement and Release form, and submit it to Legal Services
								for review, to the Executive Director, <abbr
									title="Strategic Policy Development and Integration Directorate">SPDID</abbr> for
								approval and signature, and then to the contractor for acceptance and signature. When
								the contractor&#39;s written acceptance of the Settlement and Release document is
								received, along with the final invoice, they are placed on the Price Support
								Directorate (PSD) file, and a copy forwarded to the contracting officer for the
								procurement file. A copy is also sent to the client to issue payment.</li>
							<li>If the contractor rejects the proposed settlement, the termination claims officer will
								advise the contractor, in writing, of the Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) services

					<li>Payment of the Settlement<br>When a partial payment or final settlement payment related to a

						Directorate (SPDID), the termination claims officer will place the original of the completed
						document on the Price Support Directorate (PSD) file, and make arrangements to implement the
						approved settlement payment.</li>

				</header>
				<ol class="double-space" type="a">
					<li>The decision to terminate a contract for default should be made only after all other possible
						solutions have been explored. In all cases, the advice of Legal Services must be obtained at an
						early stage, to ensure that any proposed action will not prejudice Canada&#39;s legal position
						and that the termination is legally enforceable.</li>
					<li>Failure to take action may prejudice Canada&#39;s interests.<br>If a contract is secured by
						surety bonds, termination of the contract may change the existing contractual relationship with
						the bonding company.</li>
					<li>Canada has the right to terminate all or any part of the contract for default if:<ol type="i">
							<li>The contractor fails to make progress, so as to endanger performance of the contract.<ol
									type="A">
									<li>The contracting officer may provide the contractor in writing with a reasonable
										period of time, normally ten days, to rectify the situation. If this period must
										be longer, the contracting officer may require the contractor, within ten days,
										to show evidence of corrective action.</li>
									<li>If the contractor does not rectify the situation, the contracting officer may,
										subject to the limitations in the default clause, initiate action to terminate
										the contract for default.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>The contractor fails to perform any provision of the contract.<br>If the contractor does
								not rectify such a defect within ten days of receipt of a notice from the contracting
								officer, the contracting officer may, within the limitations set forth in the default
								clause, initiate action to terminate the contract in whole or in part for default.</li>
							<li>The contractor fails to deliver the goods or perform the services within the time
								specified in the contract.<ol type="A">
									<li>In the absence of excusable delays, Canada has the right to terminate the
										contract immediately, regardless of how slight the delay may be. This includes
										the right to accept or reject goods shipped, but not yet delivered. In addition,
										if the contractor does make timely delivery, but delivers defective goods or
										improperly performs services, and is unable to take corrective action within the
										unexpired delivery schedule period, Canada also has the right to terminate for
										default.</li>
									<li>Whenever a contracting officer contemplates termination of a contract for
										failure to deliver on time, the contractor must be so advised, as soon as
										possible, after the default occurs. Failure to take such action may prejudice
										Canada&#39;s position.</li>
									<li>when there is reasonable assurance that delivery will be made, even though late,
										it may be desirable to discuss extension of the delivery time with client. If
										the delivery date is extended, negotiation for some kind of consideration may be
										appropriate. This constitutes a conditional amendment (see section <a
											href="#section-8.70.5">8.70.5 Amending Contracts</a>), which triggers the
										requirement for a <abbr

								</ol>This situation would arise when delivery would be further delayed by terminating

					<h3>Action to Recover Loss or Damage</h3>
					<ol class="double-space" type="a">
						<li>After termination, the contracting officer will determine the actual amount or best estimate

							from the contractor.<br>Estimates of loss or damage should include any amount in excess of
							the contract price, which Canada may be obliged to pay in procuring the goods or services

						<li>The contracting officer must refer claims to Legal Services when a contract is secured by a
							security deposit (government guaranteed bonds, bills of exchange, irrevocable standby
							letters of credit), or when Canada has a claim against a contractor that is related to a

						<li>If payment is not received within 60 days of the date of issue of the invoice, then <abbr

					<li>All indications from any source of unreasonably high profits realized from any contract placed
						pursuant to the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-1/"
								rel="external">Defence Production Act</a></cite>, or from any contract other than
						competitive firm price awarded pursuant to the <cite><a
								href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-38.2/" rel="external">Department of
								Public Works and Government Services Act</a></cite> should be reviewed in consultation
						with the Director, Acquisition Program Integrity Secretariat (APIS).</li>
					<li>Negotiated Refunds:<ol type="i">
							<li>Normally, the first step in negotiating a refund is for the contracting officer and
								<abbr title="Acquisition Program Integrity Secretariat">APIS</abbr> to review the
								evidence available, and decide whether the profits realized by the contractor can be
								recommended for acceptance or are in excess of what is considered to be fair and
								reasonable. In the event that the evidence is incomplete or inconclusive, consideration
								should be given as to whether the contractor will be approached for a statement of its
								position or whether a request will be forwarded to Audit Services Canada for additional
								verification. When all the evidence necessary is assembled, a final review will be made
								to determine what, if any, amount should be refunded, and the method of payment.</li>
							<li>In an attempt to ensure that suppliers are being treated consistently throughout Public
								Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), the Cost and Profit Assurance Group (CPAG)
								will distribute to the members of the Contract Audit Review Committee the proposed
								action plan of the contracting officer in respect to a contractor&#39;s excess profit,
								identified through audit. Any comments or concerns with the action plan should be
								communicated to <abbr title="Cost and Profit Assurance Group">CPAG</abbr> within
								ten working days. <abbr title="Cost and Profit Assurance Group">CPAG</abbr> will
								consolidate the input and forward it to the lead contracting authority for
								consideration.</li>
							<li>In some cases it will be in order to recover excess profits by deduction from current
								claims, or a part recovery may be affected through an assignment of income tax refunds.
								Ordinarily, however, the contractor will be expected to remit the full amount by cheque.
								If it appears that this action will create an unreasonable hardship, extended terms of
								payment may be considered.</li>
							<li>The agreed upon amount to be refunded and the terms of settlement will be set out in a
								letter to the contractor, approved by Legal Service, and signed by the responsible
								officer of the sector/region. Copies of this letter are to be sent to the Director,
								Acquisition Program Integrity Secretariat (APIS).</li>
							<li>After settlement is completed, it may be desirable to release the contractor from
								further obligation by detailing, in a formal agreement, the contract to which the
								settlement relates. Legal Services should draft this agreement.</li>
							<li>Cheques forwarded by the contractor should be made payable to the Receiver General and
								mailed to the contracting officer. The contracting officer will pass them to <abbr
									title="Cost and Profit Assurance Group">CPAG</abbr> who will forward them to the
								Chief Financial Officer of the client.</li>
							<li>Reference should be made to section <a href="#section-10.70">10.70 Recovery and
									Disposition of Contract Claims Adjustments Process</a>.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Voluntary Refunds:<ol type="i">
							<li>Where a contracting officer receives notice from a contractor that they desire to return
								excess profits, or if a contractor voluntarily forwards a cheque in refund of such
								profits, the contracting officer should request a statement showing:<ol type="A">
									<li>a summary of the excess profits by contracts; and</li>
									<li>an explanation of the principal reasons, which accounts for the excess and how
										the amount was arrived at.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Pending an appraisal of the information given by the contractor and of the particular
								circumstances of the case, any cheques received should be sent immediately to the
								Director, <abbr title="Acquisition Program Integrity Secretariat">APIS</abbr>,
								accompanied where possible, by a statement, showing the distribution of the refund over
								the contracts affected. The Director, <abbr
									title="Acquisition Program Integrity Secretariat">APIS</abbr>, will then forward the
								cheques to the Chief Financial Officer for the client.</li>
							<li>In deciding how extensive a review should be carried out in each case, the determining
								factors will be:<ol type="A">
									<li>the value of the contracts affected, and the total amount of the contracts let
										to the contractor;</li>
									<li>the explanations given by the contractor, as to the procedure followed in
										arriving at the amount of the refund;</li>
									<li>the capacity known to the contractor for assembly and interpretation of costs in
										accordance with Contract Cost Principles <a
											href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2">1031-2</a>,
										if applicable.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>If there is doubt as to the accuracy of the contractor&#39;s computations or if it
								appears that there may be other excess profits which have not been declared, then a full
								inquiry must be instituted;</li>
							<li>A final decision will be agreed upon by consultation between the sector/region concerned
								and the Director, <abbr title="Acquisition Program Integrity Secretariat">APIS</abbr>,
								and this conclusion will be communicated to the Chief Financial Officer of the
								appropriate client department.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Refunds from Subcontractors:<p>Refunds from subcontractors should be handled in accordance with
							the above procedures. In addition, however, it will be necessary for <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to keep the prime
							contractor informed of its negotiations with the subcontractor, and in some cases, it will
							be preferable to deal with the subcontractor through the prime contractor. If the refund
							results from a contractual provision in effect between the prime contractor and the
							subcontractor, then the refund should be effected by the prime contractor. If the refund
							arises from circumstances not envisaged in the subcontractor&#39;s contractual arrangements
							with the prime contractor, then the refund should be effected by <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>, and should not result
							in a windfall being realized by the prime contractor.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Assignment of Income Tax Refund:<ol type="i">
							<li>In the event that a settlement from the contractor must be financed partly from the
								proceeds of its income tax refund, the sector/region concerned will endeavor to obtain a
								voluntary assignment of the income tax refund in the following terms:<p>&quot;Receiver
									General of Canada<br>Ottawa, Ontario</p>
								<p>(Company) <var title="blank">______________</var> of the City of <var
										title="blank">_________</var> in the Province of <var
										title="blank">______________</var> does hereby authorize and direct that any
									amounts presently due or accruing due to it in the future from the Canada Revenue
									Agency, be applied in reduction of its debt to His Majesty the King in right of
									Canada in the amount of $ <var title="blank">___________</var> on account of <var
										title="blank">________</var>&quot;.</p>
							</li>
							<li>In the case of a corporation, the direction should be under the seal of the Corporation
								and the signature of duly authorized officers. The form, which should be a separate
								document and not embodied in a letter, should then be passed by the sector/region to the
								Director General, Finance, Corporate Services, for processing in accordance with normal
								government practice. Treasury Board authorization is not required.</li>
							<li>Whether the assignment is voluntary or pursuant to section 155 (Deduction and set-off)
								of the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/"
										rel="external">Financial Administration Act</a></cite>, the Finance Sector
								assumes the responsibility of notifying Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) of the assignment.
								The manner in which money is transferred from <abbr
									title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> to <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>, or to the
								Department of National Defence (in the case of refunds to its own votes) is a matter for
								decision by the Finance Sector. However, the transfer will be made either by means of a
								Receiver General cheque or an interdepartmental Journal Voucher. Under either method,
								the transfer advice will be passed to the sector/region concerned who will forward it to
								the Director General, Finance Sector.</li>

				<h3 id="overview-text">Overview of the Process Chart - Text version</h3>
				<p>This flowchart shows the full mandatory steps of the Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy
					(VPCMP). The flowchart is divided into the four phases of the procurement process: Phase 1:
					Pre-Contractual, Phase 2: Contracting, Phase 3: Contract Administration, and Phase 4: Post Contract.
					The Pre-Contractual and Contracting phases incorporate the risk considerations for applying the
					<abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr>. The Contract Administration
					and the Post Contract phases are where the <abbr
						title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> process is applied. Each
					required step is indicated in the relevant phase of the procurement process. For example, it must be
					determined at the Pre-Contractual Phase if a sector/region program exists.</p>
				<h4>Risk considerations for applying <abbr
						title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> (Phases 1 and 2)</h4>
				<h5>Phase 1: Pre-Contractual</h5>
				<p>In this phase, the impact of vendor performance issues on the procurement strategy must be determined
					by following these steps:</p>
				<ul class="no-markers">
					<li><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Assess the impact of performance issues that might arise, as part of
						procurement risk management and commodity research. For sole source contracts, access the Vendor
						Information Management (VIM) system to verify if a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure (VPCM)
						applies prior to negotiation of terms and conditions.</li>
					<li><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Decision: Does a sector/region program exist?<ul>
							<li>If yes, follow sector/region program process for evaluating bids. Stop reading the
								contents of the chart.</li>
							<li>If no, proceed to Step 3 of Phase 1.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Decision: Assess whether a sector/region program is required.<ul>
							<li>If yes, develop a sector/region program using <a href="#annex-8.12">Annex 8.12</a> of
								the <cite>Supply Manual</cite>. Until the program is operational, the contracting
								officer is to follow the generic process. Proceed to Phase 2: Contracting (risk
								considerations for applying a <abbr
									title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr>).</li>
							<li>If no, proceed to Phase 2: Contracting (risk considerations for applying a <abbr
									title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr>).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Phase 2: Contracting</h5>
				<p>This phase gives the right to reject bids at evaluation stage. The right to reject also applies to
					offer and arrangements. The process is described in following steps:</p>
				<ul class="no-markers">
					<li><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Include performance criteria for evaluating vendor performance over
						the life of contract.</li>
					<li><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Decision: Determine whether a <abbr

				<h5>Phase 3: Contract Administration</h5>
				<p>Assessment of vendor performance must be done during the contract period. Other performance records
					are added when significant issues require a note as per paragraph <a
						href="#section-8.180.15.1">8.180.15.1</a> (h) of the <cite>Supply Manual</cite>. The process is
					described in the following steps:</p>
				<ul class="no-markers">
					<li><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Monitor and document poor vendor performance with client. See
						paragraph <a href="#section-8.180.15.1">8.180.15.1</a> (b) of the <cite>Supply Manual</cite> for
						information on required documentation.</li>
					<li><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Decision: Determine whether performance issues are corrected.<ul>
							<li>If yes, contract ends normally. Stop reading the contents of the chart.</li>
							<li>If no, proceed to Step 3 of Phase 3.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Decision: Determine if there is an operational requirement to continue
						contract.<ul>
							<li>If yes, offer conditional amendment in lieu of a termination for default and proceed to
								Step 4 of Phase 3.</li>
							<li>If no, terminate contact for default and <a href="#step5-phase3">skip to Step 5 of Phase
									3</a>.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Decision : Is conditional amendment accepted?<ul>
							<li>If yes, issue conditional amendment and proceed to Step 5 of Phase 3.</li>

									last six years. The column headings identify what determines the severity of a
									debarment: <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> History,
									Consequence. The number of <abbr

					</li>
					<li><strong>Consistency in Assessments</strong>
						<p>Given that every default situation is different, it is important to allow latitude to
							contracting officers and client departments in the assessment of their particular cases.</p>
						<p>The following guidance is provided to ensure consistency across <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Acquisitions Program.
						</p>
						<p>On the assessment form, the term &quot;Impact&quot;, combined with the words
							&quot;High&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; or &quot;Low&quot;, are used to characterize the
							severity of impact of a default situation.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Guidance on Factors to Consider in Determining Impact</strong>
						<p>In determining the severity of impact of a default situation, two factors relating to vendor
							performance must be considered: the consequences and the behaviour of the vendor as
							described below.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Factor 1: Consequences<p>The determination of the consequences for government operations
									resulting from the default is the most important factor to take into consideration.
									In determining the consequences, Canada shall consider, but not be limited to, the
									following:</p>
								<ol type="i">
									<li>endangerment/injury/death of human beings;</li>
									<li>diminishment in the quality and timeliness of providing services to the Canadian
										public;</li>
									<li>the complication of any possible success of future related government
										operations;</li>
									<li>wasting of public money/resources;</li>
									<li>destruction of property.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Factor 2: Behaviour of the Vendor<p>The level of negligence of the vendor in creating
									the default situation and the efforts (degree of cooperativeness) demonstrated by
									the vendor in order to assist the government mitigate the consequences of the
									default.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Guidance on how to determine whether the default has a High, Medium or Low Impact as it
							relates to each performance issue (i.e. time of delivery, quality of product or service,
							other)</strong>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>
								<p>High impact</p>
								<p>The vendor defaulted on a requirement that was essential to an important and urgent
									or ongoing government operation which resulted in the success of an important
									operation being compromised.</p>
								<p><em>Example</em>: A vendor failed to deliver key military equipment for an ongoing
									in-theatre operation overseas, resulting in a diminishment of Canada’s military
									capability for this important international mission. The default situation increased
									the danger for military personnel and international partners and compromised the
									success of the mission. The vendor was made aware of the fact that they were in
									default and was uncooperative to help mitigate the damage caused.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Medium impact</p>
								<p>The vendor defaulted on a requirement and the government department incurred
									significant consequences. This resulted in complicating government operations in the
									short or medium term.</p>
								<p><em>Example</em>: A vendor did not provide acceptable routine maintenance services on
									equipment used by a specific government department which provides important but not
									critical services to the Canadian public. The vendor attempted to cooperate when the
									problem became evident but was unable to resolve it and had been clearly delinquent
									in failing to recognize and indicate in their bid that their abilities were limited.
								</p>
								<p>As a result of the inadequate maintenance work performed by the vendor, regular
									government operations were rendered partially unreliable. The consequences of the
									default were decreased efficacy and efficiency of government operations, and
									therefore diminished service to the Canadian public. This service was hindered for a
									period of many weeks until a new vendor capable of correcting the problem was found.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Low impact</p>
								<p>The vendor defaulted on a low dollar value requirement which was neither urgent nor
									critical to ongoing government operations. This default stemmed from factors
									partially out of the vendor’s control.</p>
								<p><em>Example</em>: A vendor failed to deliver supplies because their foreign supplier
									has suddenly stopped making the specific product contracted for. This material was
									intended for the stockroom supply shelves and did not have a critical application
									and could be obtained from other sources. The vendor had proactively communicated
									their inability to provide the supplies, provided a full explanation and were
									amenable to helping in whatever manner they could. The consequence was that the
									procurement officer had to repeat the procurement and supplies in the stockroom were
									a bit lower than usual.</p>

						<li>One of the most important tasks for the <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> manager relative to a
							new <abbr title="Major Crown Project">MCP</abbr> is to integrate into the Project Team, as
							soon as possible, and ensure participation at all levels of the project. One of the key
							requirements after establishing the operational objectives of the project is the development
							of the procurement strategy for the equipment, parts and services that will be delivered by
							the project. This is also one of the key areas of interest for ministers when considering
							the Memorandum to Cabinet and/or the <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Submission.
							Therefore, the Project Team must get involved in the project, as early as possible, to
							ensure best value of the procurement, and that clients consider all possible strategies
							before committing the project to solutions, which may subsequently conflict with government
							procurement policies and strategic objectives. Contracting officers should analyze with the
							client what opportunities may exist to support their obligations as well as their
							departmental targets related to green procurement and accessible procurement. Successful
							implementation of the Policy on Green Procurement requires the identification and
							implementation of environmental performance opportunities at both the strategic and
							operational levels, taking into consideration specific departmental buying patterns,
							sustainable development targets and other Government of Canada priorities.</li>
						<li>Best value is not confined to the contractual process; it is equally important at the
							requirements definition stage. For many acquisitions, especially for <abbr
								title="Major Crown Projects">MCPs</abbr>, it is at this earlier stage that best value
							may be achieved. Trade-offs should be made among factors such as quality, service, cost,
							procurability, environmental considerations and socio-economic considerations linked to a
							particular industry or region of the country. Quality and the desired performance level
							should be related to intended use. The most desirable technical quality or suitability is
							not necessarily the most desirable procurement because it may not be the most economical. In
							complex acquisitions, a cost/benefit analysis may balance technical quality against such
							factors as initial and operating costs, economic life, service, maintenance and repair.</li>

					<ol class="double-space" type="a">
						<li>A vital aspect in government contracting is the role played by <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and its relationship
							with client departments at all stages in the life cycle management of goods and services in
							a <abbr title="Major Crown Project">MCP</abbr>. Details of the <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>-client relationship
							will normally be covered in a signed general Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and its client
							departments. These may be adjusted to suit particular <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>-client agreements.
							Acquisitions of a special or significant nature may require specific <abbr
								title="Memorandums of Understanding">MOUs</abbr> and more detailed treatment, such as
							that outlined in the <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> policy <a
								href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12040" rel="external">Management of

							what they want, where and when. <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> is normally responsible
							for determining how goods and/or services will be provided to meet the needs of clients.
						</li>
						<li>In terms of life cycle management, this means that:<p>Requirements definition is, in varying
								degrees, a client responsibility, depending on government policy and the type of goods
								and/or services. By and large, the more technically complex, special, or unique the
								requirement, the more it will be a client responsibility to define. Conversely, the more
								common an item, the less need for client input, except, for example, to specify the
								quantity. Acquisition is a <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> responsibility, use
								is a client responsibility, and disposal of goods is a <abbr
									title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> responsibility.</p>
						</li>

							systematic rotation functionality that matches the specifics of the requirement with

					<ol class="double-space" type="a">
						<li>There are three primary methodologies used in the procurement of construction services for
							projects:<br>
							<ol class="single-space" type="i">
								<li>Design-Bid-Build (D-B-B);</li>
								<li>Design-Build (D-B);</li>
								<li>Construction Management (CM).</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The roles, relationships and responsibilities of the contracting parties vary considerably
							for each methodology. Choosing the optimum methodology is a key consideration for the
							project team. For construction services, the project team is composed of Real Property
							Contracting (RPC) of the Real Property Branch (RPB) and the client.</li>
						<li>Many variations exist for each approach and the selection of one methodology over another
							should be carefully analyzed by all stakeholders during the development of the risk
							management plan, well in advance of the procurement, in order to determine the inherent
							risks, advantages and disadvantages associated with each methodology. The selection of a
							particular methodology for the delivery of construction services is based upon an analysis
							of those risks identified in the plan that may impact the priority objectives of the project
							during the project&#39;s planning and implementation stages.</li>
						<li>Each methodology has advantages and disadvantages and one may be more suitable than another
							for any given project. The project team must weigh both the benefits and the shortcomings of
							using a specific methodology on their project. Traditionally, <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> has accepted the <abbr
								title="Design-Bid-Build">D-B-B</abbr> methodology as the standard delivery process for
							construction projects. Although it may be time consuming, <abbr
								title="Design-Bid-Build">D-B-B</abbr> provides the project team with a better
							&#39;comfort level&#39; concerning costs and quality. Since design is 100 percent complete
							before construction begins, changes should be minimal.</li>
						<li><abbr title="Construction Management">CM</abbr> and <abbr title="Design-Build">D-B</abbr>
							have been used extensively in the private sector, but used sometimes in <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>. A bid solicitation, in
							the form of a Request for Proposal, is used for both these methodologies in order to
							determine the successful supplier. Design-Build solicitations should also include an
							honorarium for at least three suppliers that continue to the phase two of the selection
							process to compensate them for work not normally required in the submission of a proposal.
						</li>
						<li><abbr title="Real Property Contracting">RPC</abbr> generally uses an invitation to tender
							for construction contracts, with a public opening shortly following the specified closing
							time. The tenders are generally evaluated on the basis of the lowest priced responsive
							tender. Suppliers must submit their tenders in accordance with the invitation to tender and
							associated specifications and drawings. Contracting officers should consult the Standard
							Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual clause <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/R/R2710T">R2710T</a>
							for information on the submission of bids.</li>
						<li>Prequalification of suppliers is not normally done. If required, justification should be
							provided for prequalification and the criteria established to ensure that the industry can
							respond appropriately. Although a two-stage prequalification process may be necessary, a
							two-envelope process is the preferred method in construction. Suppliers are asked to submit
							two sealed envelopes, where envelope &quot;A&quot; will include the response to the
							prequalification requirements (almost always a pass/fail type of criteria). If the content
							of envelope &quot;A&quot; demonstrates that the supplier is qualified, the envelope
							&quot;B&quot;, including the price and bid security, is normally opened publicly with other
							responsive bids.</li>
						<li>For requirements over $100,000, contracting officers must use the construction terms and
							conditions imposed by Treasury Board Secretariat (see clauses in <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/R">subsection
								5-R</a> of the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions [SACC] Manual). Bid security
							and contract security (clause <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/R/R2890D">R2890D</a>)
							are also requirements above this threshold. The client should identify if additional or
							specialized insurance is required in the Insurance Terms for the contractor.</li>
						<li>The Federal Contractors Program for employment equity does not apply to construction
							contracts.</li>
						<li>The Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> has
							delegated to Real Property Branch (RPB) the ability to amend construction and maintenance
							contracts awarded by Acquisitions Branch (AB). This authority must be deducted from <abbr
								title="Acquisitions Branch">AB</abbr> authorities to ensure that <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> does not exceed its
							overall authority from Treasury Board. The <abbr title="Real Property Branch">RPB</abbr>
							Project Manager will submit, with the requisition, a risk management plan that will identify
							items that may result during the construction project. This plan will include a suggested
							dollar value called the &quot;Risk Management Contingency&quot;. <abbr
								title="Acquisitions Branch">AB</abbr> will review the plan and the suggested dollar
							value, and will establish an amount to seek approval for a Pre-approved Amount for
							Anticipated Amendments (PAAA).This amount will be used for subsequent amendments to the

					<li>The <abbr title="Co-Operative Logistics / Supply Support Arrangement">COLOG/CLSSA</abbr> was

					<li><abbr title="Co-Operative Logistics / Supply Support Arrangement">COLOG/CLSSA</abbr>s allows for

						<abbr title="United States">US</abbr> <abbr title="Department of Defense">DoD</abbr> through a
						Foreign Military Sales Order (FMSO) I case that establishes stock levels, which is adjusted as
						required, depending on usage. <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales Order">FMSO</abbr> I cases are
						to be viewed as investments into the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> <abbr

							title="Foreign Military Sales Order">FMSO</abbr> II cases allows the purchasing country to
						submit requisitions for consumable items directly into the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>
						<abbr title="Department of Defense">DoD</abbr> supply chain. <abbr

								<li>the Annual List of items procured through <abbr

							</ol>This is not a part of the establishment of the contract but rather action that occurs
							after the contract is established and throughout the life of the contract as long as <abbr
								title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> requisitions are submitted against the case.
						</li>
						<li>The following summarizes the Referral Program:<ol class="double-space" type="i">
								<li>When the extended price of an item is US $20,000 or more, the <abbr
										title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr> <abbr
										title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> Office responsible for submitting
									requisitions through <abbr title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> on the <abbr

										title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> <abbr
										title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> Operations Office (Defence and Major
									Projects Sector [DMPS]).</li>
								<li>The purpose of this referral is to allow <abbr
										title="Defence and Major Projects Sector">DMPS</abbr> to review the procurement
									to determine whether procurement through Canadian and/or other sources is more
									advantageous to Canada.</li>
								<li>The <abbr title="Defence and Major Projects Sector">DMPS</abbr> <abbr
										title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> Operations Office coordinates the
									review with input from the <abbr
										title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> product
									managers as required.</li>
								<li>If it is determined that the item is available from the Canadian industry,
									procurement action should be completed in Canada unless it is established that such
									action is not justifiable from a cost standpoint or that other conditions are
									unacceptable, particularly as they pertain to operational requirements. Similarly,
									if it is determined that the item is available at less cost from any other
									commercial source of supply, procurement action may be completed commercially unless
									it is established that such action is not justifiable from a total cost standpoint
									or that other conditions are acceptable, particularly as they pertain to operational
									requirement.</li>
								<li>If the item cannot be procured through the Canadian or foreign-based companies,
									<abbr title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr> will be advised to demand it
									from the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> <abbr
										title="Department of Defense">DoD</abbr> through <abbr
										title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr>.</li>
								<li>All referrals should be processed as expeditiously as possible. A full reply or at
									minimum, an interim reply will be provided to <abbr
										title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr> within 30 days of receipt of
									the referral.</li>
								<li>The second portion of the demand Referral Program is that the <abbr
										title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr> <abbr
										title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> Office, responsible for the <abbr
										title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> program, will forward quarterly to

									list all procurement through <abbr title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> over
									the last quarter, regardless of value or priority.</li>
								<li>The third portion of the Referral Program is similar to the second portion except
									that it is based on an annual list being provided by <abbr
										title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr> of all procurement through
									<abbr title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> for the last fiscal year. A
									similar review as the one performed for the quarterly reports may be conducted.</li>
								<li>The purpose of these reviews is to provide an overview of procurement being done
									through <abbr title="Co-Operative Logistics">COLOG</abbr> over a period of time.
									This would not be visible with only a review of procurement of individual items with
									a value over US $20,000. This review will allow <abbr
										title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to seek sources
									based on requirements demanded over time. Often supply of an individual item may not
									be attractive to a supplier; however, when procurement of individual items over a
									period of time is collectively viewed, the combined value may be very attractive to
									a supplier.</li>

						<li>The Defence Production Loan Account (DPLA) provides <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with an account to make
							loans or advances to aid in defence procurement such as working capital loans or advance

						<li>Although the Adjustment of Accounts Act of 1980 eliminated the term Defence Production
							Revolving Fund (DPRF) from the <cite><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/d-1/"
									rel="external">Defence Production Act</a></cite>, <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> was advised by Treasury
							Board that it will continue to designate and operate the <abbr
								title="Defence Production Revolving Fund">DPRF</abbr> for other than loan transactions.
							Thus the <abbr title="Defence Production Revolving Fund">DPRF</abbr> provides <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> with a budgetary
							account to purchase defence supplies, to make payment for such, and to get reimbursed out of
							an appropriation of a client (for example, Department of National Defence) or by an agent of
							Canada or by an associated government. The <abbr
								title="Defence Production Revolving Fund">DPRF</abbr> can be used for the following
							purposes:<ol class="single-space" type="i">
								<li>finance the stockpiling of &quot;essential&quot; materiel or defence supplies;</li>

						<li>The <abbr title="Defence Production Revolving Fund">DPRF</abbr> was established for interim

							whoever receives the finished product. As such, the <abbr
								title="Defence Production Revolving Fund">DPRF</abbr> can be used to make initial
							payments and subsequently recover such payments from the client. It is simply a temporary
							accommodation, and it would be illegal and improper to use it for a permanent commitment of

								title="Defence Production Revolving Fund">DPRF</abbr> requires that money expended will
							be reimbursed at the time delivery is made to the client, such use does not preclude the
							making of progress payments to suppliers and the interim recovery of these progress payments
							from the client.</li>
						<li>Expenditures charged to the <abbr title="Defence Production Revolving Fund">DPRF</abbr> may
							be used for the following purposes:<ol class="double-space" type="i">

										class="single-space" type="A">

						<li>Modern treaties, also known as Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements (CLCAs), are typically
							tripartite, including Indigenous organizations or nations, the Crown, and
							provincial/territorial governments as signatories. They provide clarity and predictability
							with respect to land and resource rights, ownership, and management.</li>
						<li>Modern treaties/<abbr title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</abbr>s also seek to
							ensure fair treatment of Indigenous interests with respect to cultural, social, political
							and economic rights, including rights to lands, and to fish and hunt and practice their own
							cultures. The rights defined in them are constitutionally protected within section 35 of the
							<cite>Constitution Act</cite>, 1982.</li>
						<li>There are currently 25 modern treaties in effect and 22 contain economic measures with
							procurement obligations. These 25 modern Treaties are located in Yukon (11), Northwest
							Territories (4), Nunavut (1), Quebec (4), Newfoundland and Labrador (1) and British Columbia
							(4).</li>
						<li>No two modern treaties are exactly the same, and therefore each treaty has to be read and
							understood individually to determine the applicable contracting obligations.</li>
						<li>Most modern treaties/<abbr title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</abbr>s include
							measures dealing with procurement, and although these measures are not always identical in
							the various agreements, they are all aimed at enhancing economic opportunities of the
							Indigenous group benefiting from the agreement (referred to as &quot;Modern treaty/<abbr
								title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</abbr> beneficiaries&quot;), usually
							through increased possibilities of competing successfully for contracts in their settlement
							areas, or of participating in employment, training or subcontracting opportunities related
							to the procurement.</li>
						<li>Canada’s procurement obligations vary with each modern treaty/<abbr
								title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</abbr>, but can include:<ol type="i">
								<li>Separating requirements into commodity or geographic groupings, whenever practical
									and consistent with sound procurement management, to permit smaller and more
									specialized firms to submit bids;</li>
								<li>Notification of the procurement to the land claimant groups and/or modern
									treaty/<abbr title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</abbr> beneficiary
									firms;</li>
								<li>Use of modern treaty/<abbr title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</abbr>
									business directories/lists (refer to <a href="#section-9.35.60">9.35.60 Business
										Directories/Lists</a>);</li>
								<li>Use of bid evaluation criteria to benefit modern treaty/<abbr
										title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</abbr> beneficiaries, and
									wherever practical and consistent with sound procurement management; and</li>
								<li>Right of first refusal for procurements related to certain topics, e.g. archaeology,
									heritage, parks, surveying (refer to <a href="#section-9.35.40">9.35.40 Right of
										First Refusal</a>).</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>During the procurement planning stage the contracting officer must determine whether any
							modern treaty/<abbr title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</abbr>, and, if so, how
							they will affect the procurement strategy. The contracting officer must also ensure that the
							procurement file contains adequate documentation on the measures taken to address any modern
							treaty/<abbr title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement">CLCA</abbr> procurement obligations,
							especially with regards to sections <a href="#section-9.35.25">9.35.25 Requirements

						<li>
							<p>To determine if a requirement is subject to any Modern treaties/<abbr

						<li>If a procurement is subject to a <abbr

						<li>If a procurement is reserved for <abbr

							officers must then apply the Canadian Content Policy in the same manner as any other
							procurement but in the context of the Indigenous business supplier community. Contracting
							officers must determine whether there are sufficient eligible firms to carry out the
							procurement as solely limited (i.e., two or more Indigenous businesses are able to provide
							Canadian goods or services), conditionally limited (i.e., there may be two or more
							Indigenous suppliers of Canadian goods or services), or open (i.e., there is an insufficient
							number of Indigenous businesses able to provide Canadian goods or services; the procurement
							is open to all Indigenous businesses regardless of the origin of the goods and services
							supplied). (See <a href="#section-3.130">3.130 Canadian Content Policy</a>.)</li>
						<li>A bid/offer/arrangement for a set aside procurement, which includes the Canadian content
							provision, must be reviewed initially to determine whether the supplier has provided the
							necessary certificate that it is an Indigenous business. Bids/offers/arrangements meeting
							this basic certification are then assessed according to the stated Canadian content
							criteria.</li>

										procurements: Key differences</a></h2>
								<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2022-12-01</time>)</p>
							</header>
							<p>If a Public–Private Partnership (P3) is chosen as the preferred procurement option, many
								of the steps in a typical procurement process are undertaken. This includes a Request
								for Qualifications (RFQ), Request for Proposals (RFP) and response and proposal
								evaluations. Consideration should also be given to issuing a Letter of Interest (LOI) or
								a Request for Information (RFI). Information sessions, Industry Engagement activities
								and site visits will most likely be required. However, some elements of the <abbr
									title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> process differ from traditional
								procurement processes, for example:</p>
							<ol start="1" type="a">
								<li>A short list of qualified bidders is established as a result of the <abbr
										title="Request for Qualification">RFQ</abbr>. Limiting the procurement process
									to only qualified bidders will require the proper approvals (as part of the
									procurement plan).</li>
								<li>Emphasis is given to output-based specifications/requirements.</li>
								<li>An honorarium is typically provided to the unsuccessful bidders who submitted a
									compliant bid at the RFP stage. This is subject to approvals (as part of the
									procurement plan).</li>
								<li>Proposals can be brought by consortia made up of different private sector firms
									rather than an individual company. The consortia often have international, national
									and local representation.</li>
								<li>Proposals are traditionally based on high-level designs rather than the completed
									designs found in traditional procurement.</li>
								<li>Commercially confidential meetings involve many face-to-face sessions with each
									pre-qualified consortium. These meetings help ensure that the public sector&#39;s
									needs are well understood. Due diligence must be carried out to ensure information
									is released simultaneously to all involved parties. These meetings are typically
									overseen by a Fairness Monitor.</li>
								<li>Given their complexity, <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>s require
									significant involvement of third-party advisors.<ol start="1" type="i">
										<li>The Innovative Delivery Strategies Directorate can assist in obtaining
											support for Real Property Branch projects and other related projects.</li>
										<li>Within the Acquisitions Branch, the Contract Cost Analysis, Audit and Policy
											Directorate should be involved in any <abbr
												title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr> project discussion
											regarding an <abbr title="Request for Qualification">RFQ</abbr> bidder&#39;s
											financial capacity evaluation.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>There is a single Project Agreement that integrates phases of the project (design,
									build, finance, operations and maintenance) over a 25-30 year period. A draft
									Project Agreement is included as part of the <abbr
										title="Request for Proposals">RFP</abbr> and refined with the private
									sector&#39;s input during the procurement process.</li>
								<li>Procurement is completed upon the successful bidder achieving financial close,
									commercial close and subsequent signing of the Project Agreement. The next phase is
									the simultaneous design and construction, which paves the way for subsequent phases
									such as operations, occupation or delivery for the duration of the Project
									Agreement.</li>

								<li>Depending on the Public–Private Partnership (P3) project, the government may not

								<li>In a <abbr title="Public-Private Partnership">P3</abbr>, it is the private

									and equity financing.</li>
								<li>Once the asset is ready for use or the service has been delivered to a level of
									certified satisfaction, the government initiates payment to the private partner, as
									outlined in the project agreement.</li>
								<li>Payments may be subject to a holdback provision or liquidated damages (penalties)
									should the private partner not fully meet the obligations as outlined in the project
									agreement&#39;s predetermined performance specifications.</li>

				</header>
				<p>The first step in building a negotiated contract price is the establishment of a cost base. In
					cost-based pricing, the price of the contract is based on the acceptability of costs incurred, cost
					estimates, or a combination thereof with a profit margin calculated in accordance with of the <a
						href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide for
						Procurement Pricing</a>. The acceptable estimated or actual costs in a contract are determined

				<p>Low Dollar Value Contracts: Contracts valued under $50,000 do not require negotiation of profit under
					this section. (Refer to <a

						Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.2: Profit Principles for overall profit threshold).</p>
				<p>Commercial Pricing: Cost-Based Pricing Principles are not required for commercial goods and services,
					since these are used regularly for non-government purposes, and are sold by the supplier in the
					course of carrying out its normal business operations; and there is a sufficient number of buyers,
					other than the government, to establish a relevant market price for the good or service. Sufficient
					price support for a commercial price must be available to support a commercial price or Cost-Based
					Pricing Principles will apply. (Refer to <a

						Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.0.2: Commercial Pricing for guidance).</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li><strong>Contract Cost Principles</strong>
						<p>Whenever a contract price is negotiated based on costs, the costs will be determined using

							of the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual.</p>
						<p>For non-competitive contracts valued at $50,000 and over, with a fixed price or fixed time
							rate basis of payment, except in cases for the acquisition of commercial goods and services,
							the price or rate will be negotiated based on the estimated costs computed in accordance
							with the Contract Cost Principles <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a>.
						</p>
						<p>For non-competitive contracts valued at $50,000 or over, with a cost reimbursable basis of
							payment, except in cases for the acquisition of commercial goods and services, the price
							will be determined based on actual costs incurred computed in accordance with the Contract
							Cost Principles.</p>
						<p>In both of the above cases, the Contract Cost Principles will be included as a condition of
							the contract. Annex 2 Costing Standard in the <a

								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a>) is supplementary guidance for the Contract Cost Principles
							<abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clause and Conditions">SACC</abbr> <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a>,
							explaining why certain costs are considered nonapplicable when utilizing Contract Cost
							Principles. Additional information, including flow charts, decisions trees, and examples are
							available in the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.1.1 Costing Standard and Annex 2: Costing
							Standard. As an augmentation of <abbr
								title="Standard Acquisition Clause and Conditions">SACC</abbr> <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a>,
							the Costing Standard applies principles-based and risk-guided approaches to facilitate
							consistency, to improve understanding, and to support contracting officer’s professional
							judgement for determining fair, reasonable, and effective pricing. To be acceptable, a
							contract cost must meet the criteria of:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Attributable:</strong> A cost is attributable if it is incurred directly or
								indirectly for the fulfilment of the contract and it is necessary to fulfil the
								requirements of that contract;</li>
							<li><strong>Appropriate:</strong> A cost is appropriate if it, by its character and nature,
								represents a cost that is expected to be incurred in the conduct of delivering the
								contract; and</li>
							<li><strong>Reasonable:</strong> A cost is reasonable if by its nature it does not exceed
								what might be expected to be incurred in the normal delivery of the contract in
								question, whether under a competitive or non-competitive procurement.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The following specific costs categorized by cost groups are included in Section 6.0 Annexes,
							Annex 2: Costing Standard of the <a

					</li>
					<li><strong>Cost Accounting Practices Submission</strong>
						<p>Where a contract price will be based on estimated or actual costs, the contracting officers,
							in consultation with the Procurement Support Services Sector, may require a Cost Accounting
							Practices (CAP) Submission evidenced by a <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr>
							Submission Acceptance Letter to clarify the cost accounting practices to be used for
							contract pricing. The <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission is a
							formal disclosure of a contractor’s cost accounting practices including the identification
							of direct and indirect costs and disclosure of methodologies used to allocate indirect
							costs. The <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission and the <abbr
								title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Acceptance Letter (see the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.1.2) ensure that the cost accounting practices to
							be used for contract pricing are clear and understood by all parties by fully disclosing the
							acceptance of the practices during the pre-contract award period (see Section 5.1.2 Cost
							Accounting Practices (CAP) Submission and Annex 4 Process Steps for Costing Accounting
							Practices (CAP) Submission of the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a> for additional information). The <abbr
								title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission serves to reinforce the
							contractor’s obligation to comply with <abbr
								title="Standard Acquisition Clause and Conditions">SACC</abbr> <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a>.
							The <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission does not address the
							reasonableness of the amount of costs but rather the nature of the cost or costing
							practices.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Costing Discussion Papers</strong>
						<p>The discussion papers are intended to support cost interpretation and provide additional
							guidance for cost acceptability decisions to support contracting officers’ understanding of
							the complex areas in preparing for contract negotiations and in managing a contract through
							its lifecycle. The following discussion papers are found in the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 6.0 Annexes, Annex 5: Discussion Papers:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Annex 5.1.4 - Sales and Marketing</li>
							<li>Annex 5.1.5 - Executive Compensation and Bonus</li>
							<li>Annex 5.2.1 - Asset Valuation</li>
							<li>Annex 5.2.2 - Transfer Pricing</li>
							<li>Annex 5.2.3 - Production Capacity and Indirect Costs Allocation</li>
							<li>Annex 5.2.4 - Research and Development Costs</li>

					<li>This section has been greatly augmented by the <a

							Procurement Pricing</a>. For determination of profit in negotiated contracts, see the <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide for
							Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.2. Profit Principles.</li>
					<li>The policy and guidelines for the determination of the amount of profit is applicable to all
						negotiated contracts, in line with the applicability requirements detailed in Section 5.0.1
						Cost-Based Pricing Principles in the <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide for
							Procurement Pricing</a> for both goods and services. Detailed guidance can be found in the
						<a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide for

							procedures for profit determination in Supply Manual <a href="#annex-10.3.3">Annex 10.3.3
								Price analysis for agency and resale outlets</a> apply.</p>
					</li>
					<li>When for any reason it is not possible to establish an acceptable basis of price by competition
						or a fair and reasonable price assessment, the price must be negotiated. The objective of price
						negotiation is to duplicate a fair market price, while establishing a realistic division of
						responsibilities and risks between the contractor and Canada.<p>A fair market price for
							non-competitive contracts for the procurement of goods or services (other than commercial
							goods or services) must be negotiated. The objective of such negotiation is to arrive at a
							price which is considered to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances based upon an
							estimate of the costs, to be incurred in the performance of the contract, computed in
							accordance with the Contract Cost Principles <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a>,
							plus a fair profit. A fair profit is an amount no greater than that calculated in the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.2 Profit Principles and under this section.</p>
						<p>There are the following exceptions:</p>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>Contracts valued under $50,000 do not require negotiation of profit under this section.
							</li>
							<li>Contracts or parts thereof for which the price is based on catalogues, price lists or
								fee schedules where only discounts are subject to negotiation.</li>
							<li>Contracts for which the pricing is determined based on alternative approaches that are
								not addressed by Section 10.65, such as when pricing is not determined by cost plus
								profit or when profit is not calculated in accordance with 10.65(c). For such contracts,
								follow the process outlined in the <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
									Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.3 Alternative Pricing Strategies.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Profit levels will vary:<ol type="i">
							<li>to recognize the cost of money associated with the capital employed by the contractor in
								performance of the contract;</li>
							<li>to recognize the levels of general business and contractual risk assumed by the
								contractor in performance of the contract;</li>
							<li>to recognize the levels of contractual risk assumed by the contractor in performance of
								the contract.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The determination of the amount of profit attributable to each of the above factors must
						normally be made in accordance with the following guidelines and <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide for
							Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.2 Profit Principles.</li>
					<li>The profit determination template (see Annex 6.1 of the <a

							<li>Contractors are responsible for the completion of the template prior to the price

							<li>Contracting officers with the support of the Price Advisor will review the Profit
								Determination Template for accuracy and reasonability in advance of the price

								for Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.2.1 Negotiated Profit Element: Capital Employed,
							for more guidance on determination of capital employed, including objectives, factors to
							consider, formulas, examples, and template for return on capital calculations.</li>
						<li>The return on capital employed is determined in the following two parts:<ol type="i">
								<li>return on working capital employed; and</li>
								<li>return on fixed capital employed.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Standard calculation tools and templates are available for the determination of both working
							and fixed capital employed in a contract. As specified in the following sections,
							contractors must submit a schedule estimating the working capital employed and fixed capital
							employed in a contract for the profit negotiation, using the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-tools">Profit Determination
								Template</a> provided in Annex 6.1 of the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a>.</li>
						<li>Working Capital<ol type="i">
								<li>Working capital employed refers to the costs of maintaining daily operations within
									an organization. When performing work under contract with the Government of Canada,
									a contractor makes working capital investments to fund the day-to-day contractual
									operations, whether it is with current assets, such as cash and investments or with
									current liabilities, such as loans and accounts payable. (See Section 5.2.1.1 Return
									on Working Capital Employed of the <a
										href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
										Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>);</li>
								<li>The return on working capital will vary depending on the degree of working capital
									investment in a contract. The two-tiered approach provides a simplified approach for
									contracts with lower dollar costs and a full schedule approach for contracts with
									higher costs.<ol type="A">
										<li>Tier 1 return on working capital employed is optional. This simplified
											approach is intended only for contracts where the total estimated or
											acceptable contract costs are less than or equal to $1,000,000;</li>
										<li>For Tier 2 return on working capital employed, the total estimated or
											acceptable costs must be greater than $1,000,000 or for Tier 1 contracts
											where a contractor requests a Tier 2 determination. Contractors must submit
											a schedule estimating the working capital employed in a contract for the
											profit negotiation, using the Profit Determination Template provided in <a
												href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
												Guide for Procurement Pricing</a> Annex 6.1.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Fixed Capital<ol type="i">
								<li>Fixed capital employed consists of the investment’s contractors make that the
									company will use for more than one year. Fixed costs are typically purchased for use
									in the current and future years. The investment in fixed capital is capitalized so
									that the cost to the contractor can be spread out over the useful life of the asset.
									Contractors are required to invest in fixed capital for the purposes of carrying out
									contracts and the fixed capital can often be used for one or multiple contracts.
									(See Section 5.2.1.2 Return on Fixed Capital Employed of the <a
										href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
										Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>);</li>
								<li>The provision of a return on fixed capital employed is intended not only to
									compensate contractors for the cost of money associated with the fixed capital
									employed on the contract, but also to encourage investment in new capital equipment,
									the result of which is generally greater productivity and consequently reduced costs
									to Canada.<p>For the purpose of this section, the fixed capital employed is defined
										as the net book value of fixed assets, less:</p>
									<ol type="A">
										<li>land and any intangible assets;</li>
										<li>any fixed assets not in use such as idle plant; and</li>
										<li>any surplus value arising from re-appraisal.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>The return on fixed capital employed will vary depending on the degree of fixed
									capital investment in a contract. A three-tiered approach has been adopted to
									incorporate a lower dollar threshold as well as a simplified approach for contracts
									with lower levels of fixed capital investments.<ol type="A">
										<li>Tier 1 is a simplified optional approach for all contracts where the total
											estimated or acceptable contract costs are less than or equal to $1,000,000.
										</li>
										<li>Tier 2 relates to simplified optional approaches for contracts where the
											total estimated or acceptable costs are less than or equal to $20,000,000,
											and contracts with lower fixed capital intensity level, such as services
											contracts with minimal fixed capital needs.</li>
										<li>Tier 3 is a full schedule approach for contracts where the total estimated
											or acceptable contract costs are greater than $1,000,000 and contracts that
											do not meet the criteria for Tier 1 and Tier 2 or for Tier 1 or Tier 2
											contracts where a contractor requests the full Tier 3 determination.</li>

							for the various components of the contract. The level of profit on contractual risk is based
							on how much of the risk is carried by the contractor. A higher profit rate for contractual
							risk, is the result of the risk being assigned to and borne by the contractor. It is
							important to ensure the assignment of risk is clear, transparent and well defined.</li>
						<li>The following list outlines the key contractual risk factors to consider in the negotiation
							of profit. (Follow the steps listed in the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-tools">Contractual Risk
								Assessment Tool</a> in Annex 6.3 of the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a> to support the assessment of contractual risk in a
							procurement to establish an appropriate contractual risk profit rate.<ol type="i">
								<li>Basis of payment: The degree of financial risk taken on by a contractor is dependent
									on the contract basis of payment. The basis of payment (see Section 4.1 Basis of
									Payment of the <a
										href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
										Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>) determines the standard (the lowest rate in
									the range) and the available ranges of profit:<ol type="A">
										<li>fixed price: 4 to 7 percent maximum</li>
										<li>firm price: 4 to 7 percent maximum</li>
										<li>fixed time/unit rate with ceiling price: 1 to 4.5 percent maximum</li>
										<li>fixed time/unit rate without ceiling price: 1 to 3.5 percent maximum</li>
										<li>cost reimbursable incentive fee/ target cost: 1 to 4.5 percent maximum</li>
										<li>cost reimbursable fixed fee with ceiling price: 1 to 4.5 percent maximum
										</li>
										<li>cost reimbursable fixed fee without ceiling price: 0 to 1 percent maximum
										</li>
										<li>cost reimbursable no fee no ceiling price: 0 percent</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>Once the standard contractual risk profit rate is determined based on basis of
									payment, the level of contractual risk profit that varies within the ranges depends
									on the presence, likelihood, and impact of the key risk factors of:<ol type="A">
										<li>Accuracy of costing: The risk that the costing estimates are not accurate
											and the contract will cost more than planned.<p>Cost Risk Factors include:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Well established scope, requirements, and demand;</li>
												<li>Reliable cost estimates;</li>
												<li>Potential fluctuations from external factors; and</li>
												<li>Timing of negotiation.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Technical and Schedule: The risk that contract specific factors and
											requirements will impact a contractor’s ability to successfully complete the
											contract.<p>Technical and Schedule Risk Factors include:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Technical risk;</li>
												<li>Familiarity and program maturity;</li>
												<li>Performance specifications; and</li>
												<li>Durations.</li>
											</ul>

						<li>The total profit is the maximum profit amount that should be awarded under the Profit
							Principles (Section 5.2 of the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide

								for Procurement Pricing</a> Annex 6.1 illustrates the Profit Determination Process
							including all components of profit described in this section.</li>
						<li>The total negotiated profit is determined by adding together the amount of profit for each
							of the components of profit. The total profit of a contract is calculated as follows:<p>
								<strong>Total Profit = Return on Capital Employed + General Business Risk + Contractual
									Risk</strong></p>
							<ol type="i">
								<li>The total allowable amount of profit must be the lowest of:<ol type="a">
										<li>sum of supportable amounts by factor; and</li>
										<li>16 percent of the total cost.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>The total amount of profit awarded under all the above factors must in no event
									exceed 16 percent of the total contract costs.</li>
								<li>The amount of profit for all factors should be calculated separately and included in
									the price of each line item with a distinct basis of payment in the contract.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>The maximum contract profit rate will not exceed 16 percent of total contract costs, which
							represents the maximum profit threshold reflecting the highest risk and rare fixed price
							contract scenarios with significant Capital Employed, extreme General Business Risk
							(primarily Direct Labour and Overhead costs) and maximum Contractual Risk.</li>
						<li>While incentives are not included in the Profit Principle (Section 5.2 of the <a
								href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide
								for Procurement Pricing</a>) determination of the negotiated contract profit, it is
							essential to understand the impact of incentives in a procurement on the overall contract
							price. The total contract price is comprised of the total contract costs/estimated costs,
							profit, and incentives. The additional potential earnings that arise from the use of
							incentives will result in an increase in the contract price and overall profit and earnings
							to the contractor.</li>
						<li>Subcontract costs included in the contract costs will also have a degree of profit included
							in the costs that are submitted to Canada. Each subcontractor in the supply chain is
							compensated for costs incurred plus a profit. It is important to be aware that profit is
							layered into subcontract costs at each step in the supply chain, and to be aware of the
							degree or level of profit awarded to subcontractors where possible, as Canada then includes
							a final layer of profit on the total through the General Business and Contractual Risk
							profit factors. For this reason, transparency and clarity on the total cumulative profit
							within the supply chain is important where possible to understand and assess for
							reasonability and added value. Refer to Section 5.2 Profit Principles of the <a

					<li>Introduction<ol type="i">
							<li>The recovery and settlement of contract claims adjustments can only be made if the
								contract, and its terms and conditions, contain clauses that allow for audits and for
								recovery. The recovery and settlement of contract claims adjustments relate to
								overclaims and excess profit detected and reported in assurance engagement reports
								prepared for the Cost and Profit Assurance Program (CPAP). The <abbr
									title="Cost and Profit Assurance Program">CPAP</abbr> is delivered by the Assurance
								Services Group (ASG) within the Price Support Directorate (PSD) of the Procurement
								Support Services Sector (PSSS) of the Procurement Branch at Public Works and Government
								Services Canada (PWGSC). The <abbr title="Price Support Directorate">PSD</abbr> can be
								contacted by email at: <a
									href="mailto:TPSGC.PASoutiendesprix-APPriceSupport.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca"
									rel="external">TPSGC.PASoutiendesprix-APPriceSupport.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a>.
								The <abbr title="Cost and Profit Assurance Program">CPAP</abbr> employs account
								verification tools to demonstrate that the price charged to the Government of Canada is
								in accordance with the contract to assist contracting officers in safeguarding the Crown
								from overpaying on contracts, primarily in regard of major procurements. Assurance
								engagements are undertaken as a result of either an assurance strategy developed with
								the assistance of <abbr title="Assurance Services Group">ASG</abbr>’s assurance
								advisors, or as a response to risks identified by a contracting officer, price advisor,
								or other government stakeholders.</li>
							<li><abbr title="Assurance Services Group">ASG</abbr> auditors examine the support for a
								contractor’s claims against the contractor’s terms and conditions related to basis of
								payment and compares amounts claimed against the contractor’s records. Assurance
								engagement reports can provide contracting officers and their clients information in
								order to safeguard the Crown against overpaying through the detection of:<ol type="A">
									<li>Inadequate accounting and labour recording systems for accumulating and billing
										costs on Government contracts;</li>
									<li>Non-compliance with contract terms and conditions, Canada’s <a
											href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">Contract
											Cost Principles (<abbr

											Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>);</li>
									<li>Billing errors resulting from the application of incorrect rates, quantities, or
										invoiced amounts; and</li>
									<li>Profit variance in excess of authorized contract profit.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Throughout the assurance engagement, there is close collaboration and regular communication
						among all key stakeholders, specifically the Assurance Advisor, who advises the contracting
						officers regarding assurance related issues, the Auditor Team that performed the engagement, the
						<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting officer who
						manages the contract, the client department representative, and the Price Advisor, if the Price
						Advisor was involved in negotiating the pricing arrangements relevant to the contract(s) subject
						to examination.</li>
					<li>The process for the recovery and settlement of contract claims adjustments starts upon receipt
						of the assurance engagement report by the Assurance Advisor.</li>
					<li>Notification Report and Action Plan<ol type="i">
							<li>A notification report is initiated, drafted and prepared by the <abbr
									title="Assurance Services Group">ASG</abbr> Assurance Advisor. Its purpose is to
								explain the key findings and recommend actions that should be taken by contracting
								officers in dealing with the contractor’s claims for payment or excess profit, its
								accounting practices, or its internal controls. The Assurance Advisors sends this
								notification report, along with a copy of the engagement report, to the contracting
								officer. The notification report summarizes the results of the engagement report and
								provides advice on the actions required by Crown Representatives to mitigate the risk of
								overpayment on current and future contracts. The engagement report contains the full
								details of the assurance engagement results.</li>
							<li>The notification report is intended to support the contracting officer’s:<ol type="A">
									<li>negotiations with the contractor on final settlement of financial claims for
										payment;</li>
									<li>follow-up on matters of contractor compliance, as it relates to records,
										internal controls, cost accounting or billing practices;</li>
									<li>documentation and approval of the disposition of findings raised in the
										assurance engagement report; and</li>
									<li>strategic decision-making, including modification to the basis of payment,
										clarifying terms and conditions of contracts, and modifications in costing
										methodology.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>The notification report includes:<ol type="A">
									<li>A plain language description of proposed adjustments to contractor claims for
										payment with details on its findings, time period and contract(s) covered by the
										engagement, and, if observed, information on internal control or accounting
										system weaknesses;</li>
									<li>Identification of the potential risks on current and future contracts awarded to
										the Contractor based on issues identified in the audit;</li>
									<li>Recommendations requiring response by the contracting officer;</li>
									<li>A request for an action plan in response to recommendations contained in the
										notification report with expected timelines for completion.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>The action plan is prepared and approved by procurement and responds to recommendations
								contained in the notification report, as prepared by <abbr
									title="Assurance Services Group">ASG</abbr>.</li>
							<li>The contracting officer must provide the action plan to the Assurance Advisor within 30
								calendar days of receipt of the notification report.</li>
							<li>The contracting officer should provide updates to the Assurance Advisor on progress made
								against the action plan on a monthly or as required basis.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>General Assistance<p>Once the action plan is received from the contracting officer, assistance
							will be provided by the Assurance Advisor. This could include advice on the pursuit of
							recoveries, recommendations for changes in internal control in the contractor&#39;s
							accounting systems, or modifications to the terms and conditions of the contract. Also,
							assistance relates to clarifying any questions that the contracting officer may have and
							obtaining additional details from the Auditor related to the basis of support for
							adjustments to contractor claims and other matters, as may be required.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Technical Support in Negotiation of Adjustments<p>Given the technical complexity of the
							Auditor’s findings, procurement may require assistance of a professional accountant to
							support the contractor negotiations. If such assistance is required, please contact <abbr
								title="Assurance Services Group">ASG</abbr>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Rejection of Adjustments to Contractor Claims<p>Any plans to reject proposed adjustments to
							contractor claims must be approved prior to discussion with the contractor. Approvals are in
							accordance with subsection k. below and must include the client department, the Public Works
							and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) contracting officer and <abbr
								title="Procurement Support Services Sector">PSSS</abbr>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Reporting<ol type="i">
							<li><abbr title="Assurance Services Group">ASG</abbr> closely monitors, tracks and reports
								on recovery and settlement actions and follows-up with the respective contracting
								officers until all recommendations contained in the notification report have been
								resolved.</li>
							<li>On a semi-annual basis, <abbr title="Assurance Services Group">ASG</abbr> will report to
								the procurement’s Senior Management the status of recovery and resolution of adjustments
								as well as lessons learned through the course of the assurance engagement process.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Repayment of Overclaimed Amounts<p>When the contractor provides a cheque(s) to the contracting
							officer in repayment of overclaimed amounts or excess profits, the contracting officer must
							provide the following items to the Assurance Advisor within 7 calendar days of deposit:</p>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>Copy of contractor’s cheque(s);</li>
							<li>Copy of the Official Receipt from the Client Department’s Revenue &amp; Receivables
								Cashier’s Office; and</li>
							<li>Copy of the Client Department’s Refund Coding Form indicating the financial general
								ledger account coding.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Closeout<p><abbr title="Assurance Services Group">ASG</abbr> is responsible for the final
							administrative closeout of this recovery and settlement of contract claims process. Once the
							tasks contained in the action plan have been completed, the Assurance Advisor prepares a
							report summarizing the disposition of contract claims adjustments and matters related to
							contractor compliance for the contracting officer’s concurrence. Closeout is finalized upon
							the report’s approval, as delineated below, under subsection k.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Approvals of Disposition of Assurance Engagement Report<p>Sign-off thresholds with tiered
							delegations are required from all three parties, namely the client department, the <abbr
								title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority
							and <abbr title="Procurement Support Services Sector">PSSS</abbr>. The management level
							required for sign-off is determined by the total dollar value of the contract claims
							adjustments, as stated in the notification report. The sign-off thresholds are as follows:
						</p>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>Senior Directors and Regional Directors: up to and including $300,000;</li>
							<li>Director Generals: $300,001 to $999,999;</li>
							<li>Assistant Deputy Minister, Defence and Marine Procurement Branch, or Assistant Deputy
								Minister, Procurement Branch, (Signoff will be by <abbr
									title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> under which the procurement was
								awarded) $1,000,000 and over.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Disputes<p>Disagreements between contractors and Crown representatives that cannot be solved
							amicably are to be referred to Legal Services for an assessment of the facts involved,
							including the strength of the contract language concerning audits and recoveries and with a
							listing of all steps involved that led the Parties to the dispute.</p>

					<li>For more guidance on considerations and procedures of applying Alternative Pricing Principles,
						see the <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
							Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>, Section 5.3 Alternative Pricing Strategies.</li>
					<li>Alternative Pricing Principles are part of the Pricing Principles that refers to the procedures
						and guidance in place for contracting officers to follow when a contract price is established by
						applying an approach that does not fully incorporate the Cost-Based Pricing Principles outlined
						in Section 5.0.1 Cost-Based Pricing Principles of the <a
							href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s Guide for
							Procurement Pricing</a>.</li>
					<li>The purpose of the Alternative Pricing Principles is to encourage contracting officers to
						broadly consider other factors or alternative approaches in their pursuit of <strong>best
							value</strong> to Canada, in the development of contract pricing.<p>For example, these could
							include:</p>
						<ol type="i">
							<li>Access to better pricing via gainsharing or price reductions over time;</li>
							<li>Enhanced performance of government services to the public;</li>
							<li>Flexible contracting arrangements responsive to changing budgets and/or operational
								demands; or</li>
							<li>Improved contractor behaviour or customer satisfaction for goods and services rendered.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Alternative Pricing Principles can be applied when justification exists that an alternative
						pricing method might generate better value to Canada than the application of the Cost-Based
						Pricing Principles.</li>
					<li>The following requirements must be met in order to apply the Alternative Pricing Principles:<ol
							type="i">
							<li>The contract pricing is sanctioned by the delegated contracting authority;</li>
							<li>Concurrence is obtained from the client;</li>
							<li>The decision is documented as described in the procedures outlined in Section 5.3.3
								Procedures for Application of Alternative Pricing Principles of the <a
									href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-pricing/pricing-guide">Practitioner’s
									Guide for Procurement Pricing</a> ; and</li>
							<li>The record of decision showing justification, client concurrence and the contracting
								authority’s approval is shared with the Price Support Directorate (PSD).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Alternative Pricing Principles are not commonly applied and as such, guidance on specific
						alternatives is not yet in place. In the event that alternative methods are applied, contracting
						officers should ensure the alternative methods are appropriately analyzed with consideration for
						the risks and benefits by following the outlined procedures.</li>

							<li>acquisitions of manufactured products and repair and overhaul services, from Canadian

						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The two chief types of agency and resale outlets encountered when purchasing for Canada are:<ol
							type="i">
							<li>those engaged in manufacturing, which also act as agency or resale outlets representing
								other manufacturers (type 1); and</li>
							<li>those not engaged in any form of manufacturing, which act solely as agents,

								purchasing, receiving, storing, shipping and accounting (type 2).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>A type 1 agency and resale outlet would contribute to the manufacturing of the good being
						procured by adding or assembling certain parts for example, versus a type 2 agency and resale
						outlet does not contribute to any of the manufacturing and only the administrative aspects of
						moving the goods to the final purchaser.</li>
					<li>There are key differences between these two types of acquisitions in the determination of what
						costs are allowed, and how profits are determined. The procedures also differ depending on
						whether the good or service is commercial or non-commercial.</li>

						<li>The following should be considered when analyzing the price breakdown:<ol type="i">
								<li>Laid-down costs<p>Ensure that the necessary support for the price of the
										good/service quoted by the principal is provided by the bidder and that all
										trade discounts have been deducted. The applicability and amount of any added
										costs for transportation, foreign exchange, customs duty and brokerage should be
										verified. Transfer prices representing fair market value, constitute laid-down
										cost for the purposes of price analysis and profit calculations.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Cost of necessary services and overhead<p>Establishment of the cost of necessary
										services rendered by the bidder is dependent upon requirements, the type of
										organization the bidder operates, and the degree of sophistication in the
										bidder&#39;s cost accounting system.</p>
									<p>Types of services that may be considered for costing purposes:</p>
									<ol type="A">
										<li>purchasing;</li>
										<li>internal handling including unpacking, incoming inspection, inhibiting,
											warehousing, and re-packing for delivery to one or more destinations, but
											excluding costs related to the bidder&#39;s own manufacturing or other
											related costs;</li>
										<li>general and administrative expenses applicable to the activity required.
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p>After-sales activity, such as on-site installation and test should be taken into
										account in establishing the overall price structure.</p>
									<p>An examination of the overhead costs allocated to the particular buy should be
										made to ensure that the allocation represents a reasonable and justifiable
										distribution of overhead costs in accordance with the Contract Cost Principles
										<a
											href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a>.
									</p>
									<p>If Canada&#39;s requirements can be met by direct shipment from the principal,
										the bidder&#39;s charges are normally confined to the costs of purchasing and
										invoicing, and in such cases, a special direct shipment rate of overhead should
										be developed. The negotiated rates established in accordance with the foregoing
										are generally applied as a percentage additive to the laid-down costs.</p>
								</li>
								<li>Profit<p>Agency and Resale Outlet (type 1)</p>
									<p>A reasonable rate of profit is allowed on the total of laid-down costs and the
										cost of services required by Canada. The rate must be commensurate with the
										risk, the volume of resale business to Canada and other circumstances. For
										example, if the services required include the maintenance of an inventory, a
										higher rate of profit is permitted.</p>
									<p>Agency and Resale Outlet (type 2)</p>
									<p>The profit amounts should be calculated by application of the following:</p>
									<ol type="A">
										<li>Profit on laid-down costs:<p>Recognizing the cost of financing and risks
												associated with the maintenance of stocks, the maximum rates of profit
												applied to laid-down costs vary in accordance with the method of supply
												as follows:</p>
											<ol type="i">
												<li>supplied from stocks maintained and financed by the bidder: up to
													4 percent.</li>
												<li>supplied from stocks held by the bidder on consignment from the
													principal: up to 3 percent.</li>
												<li>supplied by the principal through the bidder, only when ordered by
													Canada: up to 3 percent.</li>
												<li>supplied by the principal in direct shipment to Canada: up to
													2 percent.</li>
											</ol>
										</li>
										<li>Profit on cost of necessary services and overhead:<p>Recognizing the
												associated general business risk, the rates of profit applied to the
												cost of necessary services and overhead may vary in accordance with the
												services provided and are:</p>
											<ol type="i">
												<li>where the services include those of purchasing and invoicing only:
													up to 7.5 percent.</li>
												<li>where the services include other than purchasing and invoicing: up
													to 10 percent.</li>

							negotiations</a></h2>
					<p class="datestamp">(<time title="Effective date">2023-04-20</time>)</p>
				</header>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Technology Partnership Canada (TPC) has contributed sums per <abbr
						title="Technology Partnership Canada">TPC</abbr> Project Agreements which carry provisions for
					the possible repayment of these contributions per Royalty repayment terms in these accords.</p>
				<p>In most cases, these royalty repayment terms are tied to the sale of the potential product/project
					that <abbr title="Technology Partnership Canada">TPC</abbr> contributed the funds for. The term and
					repayment percentage varies per the understanding.</p>
				<h3>Issue</h3>
				<p>In the agreements that were reviewed, the royalty payments to <abbr
						title="Technology Partnership Canada">TPC</abbr> to be made by the firm, in most instances,
					exceed the original contribution amount providing that the project has viable sales of the
					development project.</p>
				<p>The annual rate negotiation with a firm will be faced with a potential royalty repayment cost in the
					overhead rate calculation in the year that the repayment is required and made to <abbr
						title="Technology Partnership Canada">TPC</abbr>.</p>
				<h3>Cost recovery position for annual rate negotiation negotiations</h3>
				<p>For annual rate negotiation purposes, the recovery amount allowed on contracts shall be limited to
					the original <abbr title="Technology Partnership Canada">TPC</abbr> contribution per the agreement.
					The amount in excess of the original contribution shall be considered a separate element outside the
					rate negotiations and will not be an allowable contract cost.</p>
				<p>The amount of the recovery shall be determined by the original <abbr
						title="Technology Partnership Canada">TPC</abbr> agreement. For contributions that are product
					specific, a product development recovery rate will be established. For non-product specific
					agreements, the recovery will be made through a General and Administrative Overhead and shall be
					recovered over a reasonable amount of time.</p>

																			and utilized to achieve a particular
																			desirable result. Productivity ratios may be
																			measured in one of the following three ways:
																		</p>
																		<ol type="a">
																			<li>Total Output. Total Input.</li>
																			<li>Total Results Achieved. Total Resources
																				Consumed.</li>
																			<li>Effectiveness. Efficiency.</li>
																		</ol>
																		<p>The concept of productivity recognizes the
																			interplay between various factors in the
																			workplace. The output or results achieved
																			may be related to different inputs or
																			resources in the form of various
																			productivity ratios; for example, output per
																			labour hour, output per unit of material (as
																			in kilometers driven per liter of gas) or
																			output per unit of capital. Each of these
																			productivity ratios may be influenced by a
																			combination of factors, such as quality and
																			availability of materials, scale of
																			operations, rate of capacity utilization,
																			availability and throughput capacity of
																			capital equipment, attitude and skill level
																			of the work force, motivation and
																			effectiveness of the management. The manner
																			in which these factors interrelate will have
																			a bearing on the resulting productivity
																			ratio. Productivity improvements or gains
																			are generally realized in terms of increased
																			revenue or profit, better quality or
																			performance, or lower prices. (2010-01-11)
